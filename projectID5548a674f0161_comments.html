<HTML><BODY><p><b>Edited to add note about accents following letters; removal of running headers in side-notes; the final (implicit) vowel in Devanagari transcription; Fix in sample Devanagari transcription: be careful to distinguish the <i>&#257;</i>-vowel sign from the right-side bar in letters such as &#2339; and &#2358; (compare &#2339; with &#2339;&#2366;, [DV: .na] versus [DV: .naa])</b>

<p><b>Edit: please retain the pounds sign (£); do not write it out to pounds)</b>

<p>An extensive history of Gujarat (Currently a state in the west of India) published in 1896. Having lived in this state for one and a half year, and seen some of its historical land-marks, I continue to be amazed this place is so much off the tourist road-map, and this may very well be one of the most underestimated part of India.

<p>I've marked this book as hard, because it includes many words with diacritics, countless footnotes, sidenotes, and, as a bonus, several lines in Sanskrit (in Devanagari script).

<p>Often, the acute accent on letters in this book is represented by a small prime following the letter (distinguishable from an apostrophe). In that case, the accented letter should still be used.

<p>The side-note at the top which repeats the chapter heading can be treated as a running header, and removed. Sometimes, the side-note at the top also repeat the section header. Please let these stand, as in some cases, they are not repeated, but new section headers.

<p>The pages with Devanagari script amount to about 5 percent or so, mostly in the first part of the book, and mostly containing
one or two lines only. In most cases, a scientific transcription is provided as well (in which this book uses á instead of &#257;).

<p>Please type the fragments in Devanagari script like this: &#2342;&#2375;&#2357;&#2344;&#2366;&#2327;&#2352;&#2368;  becomes [DV: devanaagarii]

<p>Please glance over the page first to see whether it contains Devanagari.
In the first round: If you don't feel like transliterating the Devanagari, please just grab the next page, and then return the page with 
Devanagari to the rounds. <b>Please don't send it to the next round without transliteration</b>.

<p>In the later rounds, the same applies if you do not feel like verifying the transliteration.

<p>For those who are up to the challenge, the Devanagari script is somewhat more complex than our alphabet. Vowels have
both an independent and dependent (diacritic) shape called <i>matra</i>, and consonants always include
the short vowel a, unless this is modified by a vowel sign. When two consonants follow
each other, a complex conjunct letter is used, sometimes by cutting the left part of the first 
consonant, and joining it with the second, sometimes by placing the second consonant under the first,
and sometimes with several special symbols.

<p>For further explanation of the Devanagari script, please see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari">article in Wikipedia</a>.

<h2>Table for transliteration of Sanskrit in Devanagari script</h2>

<p><b>Important note:</b> When two letters come together that might be ambiguous, please use {} to disambiguate the characters,
example: &#2309;&#2311; should be transcribed [DV: a{}i]

<p>Please do not forget to type the implicit <hi>a</hi> after the last letter of a word, if it is not explicitly 'cut off' with a virama symbol (otherwise the conversion software will introduce a erroneous virama).
