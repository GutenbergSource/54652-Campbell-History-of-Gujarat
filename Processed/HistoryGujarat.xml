 </p><p>In further recognition of the distinguished labours of Sir James McNabb Campbell, <abbr expan="Knight Commander, Order of the Indian Empire">K.C.I.E.</abbr>, and of the services rendered by those who have assisted him in his work, His Excellency the Governor in Council is pleased to order that the following extract from Government Resolution No. 2885, dated the 11th August 1884, be republished and printed immediately after the title page of Volume I, Part I, of the Gazetteer, and published in every issue:



     <q rend="block"><p>&#8220;His Excellency the Governor in Council has from time to time expressed his entire approval of the Volumes of the Gazetteer already published, and now learns with much satisfaction that the remaining Statistical Accounts have been completed in the same elaborate manner. The task now brought to a close by Mr. Campbell has been very arduous. It has been the subject of his untiring industry for more than ten years, in the earlier part of which period, however, he was occasionally employed on additional duties, including the preparation of a large number of articles for the Imperial Gazetteer. When the work was begun, it was not anticipated that so much time would be required for its completion, because it was not contemplated that it would be carried out on so extensive a scale. Its magnitude may be estimated by the fact that the Statistical Accounts, exclusive of the general chapters yet to be reprinted, embrace twenty-seven Volumes containing on an average 500 pages each. Mr. Campbell could not have sustained the unflagging zeal displayed by him for so long a period without an intense interest in the subjects dealt with. The result is well worthy of the labour expended, and is a proof of the rare fitness of Mr. Campbell on the ground both of literary ability and of power of steady application for the important duty assigned to him. The work is a record of historical and statistical facts and of information regarding the country and the people as complete perhaps as ever was produced on behalf of any Government, and cannot fail to be of the utmost utility in the future administration of the Presidency.

     </p><p>&#8220;2. The thanks of Government have already been conveyed to the various contributors, and it is only necessary now to add that they share, according to the importance of their contributions, in the credit which attaches to the general excellence of the work.&#8221;</p></q>



 </p><p>The whole series of Volumes is now complete, and His Excellency in Council congratulates Sir James Campbell and all associated with him in this successful and memorable achievement.

 <pb n="iii"/> </p></div1><div1 id="preface" rend="toc-head(Preface)" type="Preface"><p>The earliest record of an attempt to arrange for the preparation of Statistical Accounts of the different districts of the Bombay Presidency is in 1843. In 1843 Government called on the Revenue Commissioner to obtain from all the Collectors as part of their next Annual Report the fullest available information regarding their districts.<note id="niii.1" n="1">Secretary&#8217;s Letter 4223 to the Revenue Commissioner dated 30th December 1843. Revenue Volume 1854 of 1843.</note> The information was specially to include their own and their Assistants&#8217; observations on the state of the cross and other roads not under the superintendence of a separate department, on the passes and ferries throughout the country, on the streets in the principal towns, and on the extension and improvement of internal communications. As from Collectors alone could any knowledge of the state of the district be obtained, the Collectors were desired to include in their Annual Reports observations on every point from which a knowledge of the actual condition of the country could be gathered with the exception of matters purely judicial which were to be supplied by the Judicial Branch of the Administration. Government remarked that, as Collectors and their Assistants during a large portion of the year moved about the district in constant and intimate communication with all classes they possessed advantages which no other public officers enjoyed of acquiring a full knowledge of the condition of the country, the causes of progress or retrogradation, the good measures which require to be fostered and extended, the evil measures which call for abandonment, the defects in existing institutions which require to be remedied, and the nature of the remedies to be applied. Collectors also, it was observed, have an opportunity of judging of the effect of British rule on the condition and character of the people, on their caste prejudices, and on their superstitious observances. They can trace any alteration for the better or worse in dwellings<corr>,</corr> clothing and diet, and can observe the use of improved implements of husbandry or other crafts, the habits of locomotion, the state of education particularly among the higher classes whose decaying means and energy under our most levelling system compared with that of preceding governments will attract their attention. Finally they can learn how far existing village institutions are effectual to <pb n="iv"/>their end, and may be made available for self-government and in the management of local taxation for local purposes.

 </p><p>In obedience to these orders reports were received from the Collectors of Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d Broach Kaira Th&#225;na and Kh&#225;ndesh. Some of the reports, especially that of Mr. J. D. Inverarity, contained much interesting information. These five northern reports were practically the only result of the Circular Letter of 1843.

 </p><p>The question of preparing District Statistical Manuals was not again raised till 1870. In October 1867 the Secretary of State desired the Bombay Government to take steps for the compilation of a Gazetteer of the Presidency on the model of the Gazetteer prepared during that year for the Central Provinces. The Bombay Government requested the two Revenue Commissioners and the Director of Public Instruction to submit a scheme for carrying into effect the orders of the Secretary of State. In reply the officers consulted remarked that the work to be done for the Bombay Presidency would be of a multifarious character; that the article on the commerce of Bombay would require special qualifications in the writer; that again special qualifications would be required for writing accounts of the sacred cities of N&#225;sik and P&#225;lit&#225;na, of the caves of Ajanta and Ellora, of the histories of Sindh Gujar&#225;t and Ahmednagar, and of the Portuguese connection with Western India. The Committee observed that a third form of special knowledge would be required to write accounts of P&#225;rsis Khoj&#225;s and other castes and tribes; that in short the undertaking would be one of much wider scope and greater difficulty than the preparation of the Gazetteer of the Central Provinces. Much thought would be required before the general plan could be laid down, and after the plan was fixed all sorts of questions as to arrangement and treatment of particular parts would be sure to arise. In the Committee&#8217;s opinion local revenue officers could not as a rule find time to devote to work of this description without neglecting their ordinary duties; but they could correct and amplify such information as a special officer could compile from the published and unpublished records of Government.

 </p><p>In January 1868 the Bombay Government decided that the general supervision and direction of the work should be placed in the hands of a Committee consisting of the Revenue Commissioners, the Director of Public Instruction, and the Commissioner of Customs, and that an Editor should be appointed with a small copying establishment to act under the directions of the Committee. The Editor was to give his entire time to the work and was expected to <pb n="v"/>finish it in about a year. He was to collect and arrange in alphabetical order all recorded information regarding the towns and other places of interest in each Collectorate, and to send printed on half margin each draft when completed to the local officers for verification, additions, and alterations. When the drafts were returned and corrected by the Editor, they were to be laid before the Committee. To enable the Editor to meet such expenses as a fair remuneration for articles contributed by qualified persons, and also to pay for the printing of the work with small accompanying maps, an amount not exceeding <abbr>Rs.</abbr> 12,000 was sanctioned for the total expense of the Gazetteer including the payment of the Editor. At the outset it was decided to place a portion of the sum sanctioned not exceeding <abbr>Rs.</abbr> 2000, at the disposal of the Commissioner in Sindh to secure the preparation of articles referring to Sindh. The Committee were requested to meet at Poona in June 1868 and to report to Government on the best mode of preparing and editing the Gazetteer and supervising its publication. The Collectors and Political Officers were in the meanwhile requested to ascertain what records in their possession were likely to be useful for the preparation of a Gazetteer and what papers in the possession of others and likely to be useful for the purpose were obtainable within their charge. Collectors and Political Officers were requested to send their replies direct to the Director of Public Instruction who would collect them on behalf of the Committee.

 </p><p>In August 1868 the Bombay Gazetteer Committee, composed of Messrs. A. F. Bellasis Revenue Commissioner N. D. Chairman, Mr. W. H. Havelock Revenue Commissioner S. D. and Sir Alexander Grant, Director of Public Instruction, submitted a report recommending the following arrangements:



 <list type="simple"><item>(1) That Mr. W. H. Crowe, <abbr>C.S.</abbr>, then Acting Professor in the Dakhan College, be appointed Editor of the Gazetteer with a monthly remuneration of <abbr expan="Rupees">Rs.</abbr> 200 out of the <abbr>Rs.</abbr> 12,000 sanctioned for the expense of the Gazetteer and that he should at the same time be attached as an Assistant to the Collector of Poona;     </item><item>(2) That Mr. Crowe be allowed an establishment not exceeding <abbr>Rs.</abbr> 50 a month chargeable to the grant of <abbr>Rs.</abbr> 12,000, and such contingent charges as may be passed by the Committee;     </item><item>(3) That Professor Kero Luxman Chhatre be requested to assist Mr. Crowe on various questions both local and mathematical, and that on the completion of the work a suitable honorarium be granted to Professor Kero;     </item><item>(4) That agreeably to the suggestions of Major Prescott and Colonel Francis, Mr. Light should be directed to compile for the different districts all information in the possession of the Survey Department in communication <pb n="vi"/>with the Editor of the Gazetteer who was to work under the Committee&#8217;s orders;     </item><item>(5) That the above appointments be made at present for one year only, at the end of which from the Committee&#8217;s progress report, it would be possible to state with approximate definiteness the further time required for the completion of the Gazetteer. </item></list>



 </p><p>These proposals were sanctioned on the 11th September 1868. Towards the close of 1868 Mr. (now Sir) J. B. Peile took the place of Sir A. Grant on the Committee and Colonel Francis was added to the list of the members. Adhering as far as possible to the arrangement followed in the Gazetteer of the Central Provinces, which had met with the approval of the Secretary of State, Mr. Crowe drew out the following list of subjects which was forwarded to all Collectors Sub-Collectors and Survey Superintendents:

 <pb n="vii"/></p><p>In 1869 the draft articles prepared by Mr. Crowe were submitted to Mr. (now Sir) W. W. Hunter of the Bengal Civil Service who expressed his satisfaction at the progress made. The Committee adopted certain suggestions made by Sir W. Hunter for the arrangement of the work and for obtaining fuller district figures from the Marine, Irrigation, Cotton, and Survey Offices. In March 1870 a further extension of one year was accorded. The Bombay Government directed that each Collector should choose one of his Assistants to correspond with the Editor and obtain for him all possible information from local records. All Heads of Offices were also desired to exert themselves zealously in aiding the prosecution of the work. In 1871 Mr. Crowe&#8217;s draft article on the Dh&#225;rw&#225;r District was sent to Mr. Hunter for opinion who in addition to detailed criticism on various points made the following general remarks:



 <q rend="block"><p>&#8220;My own conception of the work is that, in return for a couple of days&#8217; reading, the Account should give a new Collector a comprehensive, and, at the same time, a distinct idea of the district which he has been sent to administer. Mere reading can never supersede practical experience in the district administration. But a succinct and well conceived district account is capable of antedating the acquisition of such personal experience by many months and of both facilitating and systematising a Collector&#8217;s personal enquiries. The Compiler does not seem to have caught the points on which a Collector would naturally consult the Account. In order that the Editor should understand these points it is necessary that he should have had practical acquaintance with district administration and that he should himself have experienced the difficulties which beset an officer on his taking charge of a district or sub-division. The individual points will differ according to the character of the country. For example in deltaic districts the important question is the control of rivers; in dry districts it is the subject of water-supply. But in all cases a District Account besides dealing with the local specialties should furnish an historical narration of its revenue and expenditure since it passed under the British rule, of the sums which we have taken from it in taxes, and of the amount which we have returned to it in the protection of property and person and the other charges of civil government.&#8221;</p></q>



 </p><p>Sir William Hunter laid much stress on the necessity of stating the authority on the strength of which any statement is made and of the propriety of avoiding anything like libels on persons or classes. In 1871 Sir W. Hunter was appointed Director General of Statistics to the Government of India. In this capacity he was to be a central guiding authority whose duty it was to see that each of the Provincial Gazetteers contained the materials requisite for the comparative statistics of the Empire. As some of the Bombay District Accounts were incomplete and as it was thought advisable to embody in the District Accounts the results of the general Census of 1872, it was decided, in October 1871, that pending the completion of the census <pb n="viii"/>the Gazetteer work should be suspended and that when the results of the census were compiled and classified a special officer should be appointed for a period of six months to revise and complete the drafts. In October 1871, pending the compilation of the census returns, Mr. Crowe was appointed Assistant Collector at Shol&#225;pur and the Gazetteer records were left in a room in the Poona Collector&#8217;s Office. In September 1872 the whole of the Gazetteer records, including thirty-one articles on British Districts and Native States, were stolen by two youths who had been serving in the Collector&#8217;s Office as peons. These youths finding the Gazetteer office room unoccupied stole the papers piece by piece for the sake of the trifling amount they fetched as waste paper. Search resulted in the recovery in an imperfect state of seven of the thirty-one drafts. The youths were convicted and sentenced to a year&#8217;s imprisonment in the Poona Reformatory.

 </p><p>In 1873 Mr. Francis Chapman then Chief Secretary to Government took the preparation of the Gazetteer under his personal control. And in June 1873 Mr. James M. Campbell, <abbr>C.S.</abbr>, was appointed Compiler. An important change introduced by Mr. Chapman was to separate from the preparation of the series of District Manuals certain general subjects and to arrange for the preparation of accounts of those general subjects by specially qualified contributors. The subjects so set apart and allotted were:

 </p><p>These arrangements resulted in the preparation of the following papers each of which on receipt was printed in pamphlet form:



 </p><p>I. <hi rend="sc">Ethnology</hi>; II. <hi rend="sc">Meteorology</hi>; III. <hi rend="sc">Geology</hi>; and IV. <hi rend="sc">Botany</hi>.



 </p><p>Of these papers it has not been deemed advisable to reprint Dr. J. Wilson&#8217;s Paper on Castes as it was incomplete owing to Dr. Wilson&#8217;s death in 1875. Reprinting was also unnecessary in the case of Mr. Blandford&#8217;s Geology and of the late Mr. Chambers&#8217; Meteorology, as the contents of these pamphlets have been embodied in works <pb n="ix"/>specially devoted to the subject of those contributions. Dr. Burgess never prepared his article on the Arch&#230;ology of the Presidency, but the materials supplied by the late Pandit <corr sic="Bhagv&#225;nlal">Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l</corr> Indraji prevented the evil effect which this failure would otherwise have caused. Dr. <corr sic="Bhagv&#225;nlal">Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l</corr> also ably supplied the deficiency caused by Dr. G. B&#252;hler&#8217;s failure to contribute an article on the Early History of Gujar&#225;t. The notices of the manufactures in the more important industrial centres to some extent supply the blank caused by the absence of Mr. Terry&#8217;s contribution. Nothing came of the late Mr. Gordon&#8217;s Account of the Trade of the Presidency.

 </p><p>On the important subject of Botany besides Dr. W. Gray&#8217;s original contribution, a valuable paper On Useful Trees and Plants was prepared by Dr. J. C. Lisboa, and a detailed account of Kaira field trees by the late Mr. G. H. D. Wilson of the Bombay Civil Service. These three papers together form a separate Botany Volume No. XXV.

 </p><p>The general contributions on History contained in Vol. I. Parts I. and II. are among the most valuable portions of the Gazetteer. Besides the shorter papers by Mr. L. R. Ashburner, <abbr expan="Companion, Order of the Star of India">C.S.I.</abbr>, on the Gujar&#225;t Mutinies of 1857, by Mr. J. A. Baines, <abbr>C.S.I.</abbr>, on the Mar&#225;th&#225;s in Gujar&#225;t, by Mr. W. W. Loch, <abbr>I.C.S.</abbr>, on the Musalm&#225;n and Mar&#225;tha histories of Kh&#225;ndesh and the Bombay Dakhan, and by the late Colonel E. W. West, <abbr expan="Imperial Service Corps">I.S.C<corr>.</corr></abbr>, on the modern history of the Southern Mar&#225;tha districts, there are the Reverend A. K. Nairne&#8217;s History of the Konkan which is specially rich in the Portuguese period (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1500&#8211;1750), the late Colonel J. W. Watson&#8217;s Musalm&#225;ns of Gujar&#225;t with additions by Kh&#225;n S&#225;heb Fazl Lutfullah Far&#237;di of Surat, and the important original histories of the Early Dakhan by Professor R&#225;mkrishna Gop&#225;l Bhand&#225;rkar, <abbr>C.I.E.</abbr>, <abbr>Ph.D.</abbr>, and of the Southern Mar&#225;tha districts by Mr. J. F. Fleet, <abbr>I.C.S.</abbr>, <abbr expan="Companion, Order of the Indian Empire">C.I.E.</abbr>, <abbr expan="Doctor of Philosophy">Ph.D.</abbr> With these the early history of Gujar&#225;t from materials supplied by the late Pandit Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l Indraji, <abbr>Ph.D.</abbr>, is perhaps not unworthy to rank. The work of completing Dr. Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l&#8217;s history was one of special difficulty. No satisfactory result would have been obtained had it not been for the valuable assistance received from Mr. A. M. T. Jackson, <abbr>M.A.</abbr>, of the Indian Civil Service.

 </p><p>The importance and the interest of the great subject of Population have added several contributions to the Reverend Doctor J. Wilson&#8217;s original pamphlet of twenty-three pages. Most of these contributions appear in different District Statistical Accounts especially Dr. John Pollen&#8217;s, <abbr>I.C.S.</abbr>, accounts in Kh&#225;ndesh, Mr. Cumine&#8217;s, <abbr>I.C.S.</abbr> in Bij&#225;pur, Mr. K. Raghun&#225;thji&#8217;s in Th&#225;na and Poona, Assistant Surgeon Sh&#225;nt&#225;r&#225;m <pb n="x"/>Vin&#225;yak&#8217;s in Shol&#225;pur, Mr. P. F. DeSouza&#8217;s in K&#225;nara, and the late R&#225;o Bah&#225;dur Trimalrao&#8217;s in Dh&#225;rw&#225;r. Except the valuable articles contributed in the Statistical Account of Kachh by Major J. W. Wray, Mr. Vin&#225;yakr&#225;o N&#225;r&#225;yanand R&#225;o S&#225;heb Dalpatr&#225;m Pr&#225;njivan Khakhar, in the Account of <corr sic="K&#225;thiaw&#225;r">K&#225;thi&#225;w&#225;r</corr> by the late Colonel L. C. Barton, and in the Account of Rewa K&#225;ntha by R&#225;o Bah&#225;dur Nandshankar Tulj&#225;shankar the early date at which the Gujar&#225;t Statistical Accounts were published prevented the preparation of detailed articles on population. This omission has now been supplied in a separate volume No. IX. The chief contributions to this volume are R&#225;o Bah&#225;dur Bhimbh&#225;i Kirp&#225;r&#225;m&#8217;s Hindus, Kh&#225;n S&#225;heb Fazl Lutfullah Far&#237;di&#8217;s Musalm&#225;ns, and Messrs. Kharsetji N. Servai and Bamanji B. Patel&#8217;s P&#225;rsis.

 </p><p>Besides to these general contributors the series of Statistical Accounts owes much of their fullness and practical usefulness to District Officers especially to the labours of the District Compilers who in most cases were either Collectors or Assistant Collectors. The most important contributors of this class were for <hi rend="bold">Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d</hi> Mr. F. S. P. Lely, <abbr>C.S.</abbr>; for <hi rend="bold">Kaira</hi> Mr. G. F.

Of the accounts of Native States, the interesting and complete Gazetteer of <hi rend="bold">Baroda</hi> is the work of Mr. F. A. H. Elliott, <abbr>C.S.</abbr> The chief contributors to the other Statistical Accounts of Native States were for <hi rend="bold">Kachh</hi> Colonel L. C. Barton; for <hi rend="bold">K&#225;thi&#225;w&#225;r</hi> Colonel J. W. Watson and Colonel L. C. Barton; for <hi rend="bold">P&#225;lanpur</hi> Colonel J. W.

The names of numerous other contributors both in and out of Government service who gave help in compiling information connected with their districts have been shewn in the body of each District Statistical Account. Of these the learned and most ungrudging assistance received from Dr. J. Gerson DaCunha of Bombay requires special recognition.

 </p><p>The third main source of preparation was the Compiler&#8217;s head-quarters office. Through the interest which Mr. Francis Chapman took in the Gazetteer the Compiler was able to secure the services as Assistant of R&#225;o B&#225;h&#225;dur Bhimbh&#225;i Kirp&#225;r&#225;m who was Head Accountant in the Kaira Treasury when the Statistical Account of Kaira was under preparation in 1874. Mr. Bhimbh&#225;i&#8217;s minute knowledge of administrative detail, his power of asking for information in the form least troublesome to district establishments, and of checking the information received, together with his talent for directing the work at head-quarters formed one of the most important elements in the success of the Gazetteer arrangements. Besides to the interest taken by Mr. Francis Chapman the Gazetteer owed much to the advice and to the support of Sir W. W. Hunter, who, in spite of the delay and expense which it involved, secured the full record of the survey and other details in which the Bombay revenue system is specially rich.

 </p><p>In addition to R&#225;o Bah&#225;dur Bhimbh&#225;i, the members of the Compiler&#8217;s office whose work entitles them almost to a place among contributors are: R&#225;o S&#225;heb Krishnar&#225;o Narsinh, who drafted many of the Land Revenue and Survey Histories; the late Mr. Ganesh Bhik&#225;ji Gunjikar, <abbr expan="Bachelor of Arts">B.A.</abbr>, who drafted many of the Political Histories; the late Mr. Vaikunthr&#225;m Manmathr&#225;m Mehta, <abbr>B.A.</abbr>, and R&#225;o Bah&#225;dur Itch&#225;r&#225;m Bhagv&#225;nd&#225;s, <abbr>B.A.</abbr>, who drafted many articles on Description, Production, Agriculture, Capital, and Trade; Mr. K. Raghun&#225;thji who prepared many of the fullest caste accounts; Mr. Ratir&#225;m Durg&#225;r&#225;m, <abbr>B.A.</abbr>, who drafted many papers on places of interest; and Messrs. Yeshvant Nilkanth and Mah&#225;dev G. N&#225;dkarni who drafted many of the sections on Population, Agriculture, Capital, and Trade.

 </p><p>Other officers of Government who have had an important share in the satisfactory completion of the Gazetteer are: Mr. J. Kingsmill the former and Mr. Fr&#225;mroz Rustamji the present Superintendent of the Government Central Press and Mr. T. E. Coleman the Head Examiner, whose unfailing watchfulness has detected many a mistake. Mr. Waite the late Superintendent of the Photozincographic Press and Mr. T. LeMesurier the present Superintendent have supplied a set of most handy, clear, and accurate maps.

 <pb n="xii"/></p><p>A further means adopted for collecting information was the preparation of papers on the different social, economic, and religious subjects which had proved of interest in preparing the earliest District Statistical Accounts. Between 1874 and 1880 forty-nine question papers which are given as an Appendix to the General Index Volume were from time to time printed and circulated. The answers received to these papers added greatly to the fullness and to the local interest of all the later Statistical Accounts.

 </p><p>The Statistical Accounts of the eighteen British districts and eighty-two Native States of the Bombay Presidency, together with the Materials towards a Statistical Account of the Town and Island of Bombay extend over thirty-three Volumes and 17,800 pages. In addition to these Statistical Accounts 475 articles were prepared in 1877&#8211;78 for the Imperial Gazetteer.

 </p><p>On the west is the Arabian Sea; on the north-west is the Gulf of Cutch. To the north lie the Little Ran and the Mev&#225;d desert; to the north-east &#193;bu and other outliers of the &#193;r&#225;vali range. The east is guarded and limited by rough forest land rugged in the north with side spurs of the Vindhyas, more open towards the central natural highway from Baroda to Ratl&#225;m, and southwards again rising and roughening into the northern offshoots from the main range of the S&#225;tpud&#225;s. The southern limit is uncertain. History somewhat doubtfully places it at the T&#225;pti. Language carries Gujar&#225;t about a hundred miles further to Bals&#225;r and P&#225;rdi where wild forest-covered hills from the north end of the Sahy&#225;dri range stretch west almost to the sea.

 </p><p>The province includes two parts, Mainland Gujar&#225;t or Gurjjara-r&#225;shtra and Peninsular <corr sic="Guj&#225;rat">Gujar&#225;t</corr><corr>,</corr> the <corr sic="Saur&#225;shtra">Saur&#225;sh&#7789;ra</corr> of ancient, the K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a of modern history. To a total area of about 72,000 square miles Mainland Gujar&#225;t with a length from north to south of about 280 miles and a breadth from east to west varying from fifty to 150 miles contributes 45,000 square miles; and Peninsular Gujar&#225;t with a greatest length from north to south of 155 miles and from east to west of 200 miles contributes about 27,000 square miles. To a population of about 9,250,000 Mainland Gujar&#225;t contributes 6,900,000 and the Peninsula about 2,350,000.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Gujars.</note>The name Gujar&#225;t is from the Pr&#225;krit Gujjara-ratta, the Sanskrit of which is Gurjjara-r&#225;shtra that is the country of the Gujjaras or Gurjjaras. In Sanskrit books and inscriptions the name of the province is written Gurjjara-ma&#7751;&#7693;ala and G&#363;rjjara-de&#347;a the land of the Gurjjaras or G&#250;rjjaras. The Gurjjaras are a foreign tribe who passing into India from the north-west gradually spread as far south as Kh&#225;ndesh and Bombay Gujar&#225;t. The present Gujars of the <corr sic="Panjab">Panj&#225;b</corr> and North-West Provinces preserve more of their foreign traits than the Gujar settlers further to the south and east. Though better-looking, the <corr sic="Panjab">Panj&#225;b</corr> Gujars in language dress and calling so closely resemble their associates the J&#225;ts or Jats as to suggest that the two tribes entered India about the same time. Their present distribution shows that the Gujars spread further east and south than the J&#225;ts. The earliest Gujar settlements seem to have been in the <corr sic="Panjab">Panj&#225;b</corr> and North-West Provinces from the Indus to Mathur&#225; where they still differ greatly in dress and language from most other inhabitants. From Mathur&#225; the Gujars seem to have passed to East <corr sic="Rajput&#225;na">R&#225;jput&#225;na</corr> and from there by way of Kotah and Mandasor to M&#225;lwa, where, though their original character is considerably altered, the Gujars of M&#225;lwa still remember that their ancestors came from the Doab between the Ganges and the Jamna. In M&#225;lwa they spread as far east as Bhilsa and <corr sic="Saharanpur">Sah&#225;ranpur</corr>. From M&#225;lwa they passed south to Kh&#225;ndesh and west probably by the Ratlam-Dohad route to the province of Gujar&#225;t.

 </p><p>Like the modern Ahirs of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a the Gujars seem to have been a tribe of cattle-rearers husbandmen and soldiers who accompanied some conqueror and subsequently were pushed or spread forwards as occasion arose or necessity compelled. In the absence of better authority the order and locality of their settlements suggest that their introduction into India took place during the rule of the Skythian or Kush&#225;n emperor Kanerkes or Kanishka (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;78&#8211;106) in whose time they seem to have settled as far east as Mathur&#225; to which the territory of Kanishka is known to have extended. Subsequently along with the Guptas, who rose to power about two hundred years later (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;300), the Gujars settled in East <corr sic="Rajput&#225;na">R&#225;jput&#225;na</corr>, M&#225;lwa, and Gujar&#225;t, provinces all of which were apparently <pb id="pb3" n="3"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter I.</item><item>The Name.</item></list> </fw>subjugated by the Guptas. It seems probable that in reward for their share in the Gupta conquests the leading Gujars were allotted fiefs and territories which in the declining power of their Gupta overlords they afterwards (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;450&#8211;550) turned into independent kingdoms.

 </p><p>The earliest definite reference to a kingdom of North Indian Gujars is about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;890 when the Kashmir king &#346;ankaravarman sent an expedition against the Gurjjara king Alakh&#225;na and defeated him. As the price of peace Alakh&#225;na offered the country called Takkade&#347;a. This Takkade&#347;a<note id="n3.1" n="1">R&#225;ja Tarangini (<abbr expan="Calcutta">Calc.</abbr> Edition), V. 150, 155; Cunningham&#8217;s Arch&#230;ological Survey, II. 8.

The tract surrendered by Alakh&#225;na was probably the small territory to the east of the Chin&#225;b as the main possessions of Alakh&#225;na must have lain further west between the Chin&#225;b and the Jehlam, where lie the town of Gujar&#225;t and the country still called Gujar-de&#347;a the land of the Gujars.<note id="n3.3" n="3">Cunningham&#8217;s Arch&#230;ological Survey, II. 71.</note>

This country is about 5000 li in circuit, the capital, which is called Pi-lo-mo-lo, is 30 li or so round. The produce of the soil and the manners of the people resemble those of <corr sic="Saur&#225;shtra">Saur&#225;sh&#7789;ra</corr>. The king is of the Kshatriya caste.

General Cunningham (Ancient Geography of India, 313) and Professor Beal (Buddhist Records, II. 270) identify Pi-lo-mo-lo with B&#225;lmer or B&#225;damera (north latitude 71&#176; 10&#8242; east longitude 20&#176; 0&#8242;) in the Jodhpur State of West R&#225;jput&#225;na. This identification is unsatisfactory. B&#225;lmer is a small town on the slope of a hill in an arid tract with no vestige of antiquity. Hiuen Tsiang notes that the produce of the soil and the manners of the people of Pi-lo-mo-lo resemble those of <corr sic="Sur&#225;shtra">Sur&#225;sh&#7789;ra</corr>. This description is unsuited to so arid a tract as surrounds B&#225;lmer; it would apply well to the fertile neighbourhood of Bhilm&#225;l or Bhinm&#225;l. Since it is closely associated with Juzr that is Gurjjara the Al Bail&#225;iman of the Arabs (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;750, Elliot&#8217;s History, I. 442) may be <corr sic="Bhilmal">Bhilm&#225;l</corr>. A Jain writer (<abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> XIX. 233) mentions Bhilm&#225;l as the seat of king Bh&#237;masena and as connected with the origin of the Gadhia coinage. The date Bhinm&#225;l in a <abbr expan="Manuscript">M.S.</abbr> of <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;906 (Ditto, page 35) suggests it was then a seat of learning under the Gurjjaras.

B&#252;hler (<abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> VII. 62) identifies Nandipuri with a suburb of Broach.</note> The earlier inscriptions describe the Southern Gurjjaras as of the Gurjjara Van&#347;a. Later they ceased to call themselves Gurjjaras and traced their genealogy to the <corr sic="Pur&#225;nic">Pur&#225;&#7751;ic</corr> king Kar&#7751;a.

 </p><p>From the fourth to the eighth century the extensive tract of Central Gujar&#225;t between the North and South Gurjjara kingdoms was ruled by the Valabhis. The following reasons seem to show that the Valabhi dynasty were originally Gujars. Though it is usual for inscriptions to give this information none of the many Valabhi copper-plates makes any reference to the Valabhi lineage. Nor does any inscription state to what family Sen&#225;pati Bha&#7789;&#225;rka the founder of the dynasty belonged. Hiuen Tsiang describes the Valabhi king as a Kshatriya and as marrying with the kings of M&#225;lwa and Kanauj. The Valabhi king described by Hiuen Tsiang is a late member of the dynasty who ruled when the kingdom had been greatly extended and when the old obscure tribal descent may have been forgotten and a Kshatriya lineage invented instead. Intermarriage with M&#225;lwa and Kanauj can be easily explained. <corr sic="Rajputs">R&#225;jputs</corr> have never been slow to connect themselves by marriage with powerful rulers.

 </p><p>The establishment of these three Gujar kingdoms implies that the Gurjjara tribe from Northern and Central India settled in large numbers in Gujar&#225;t. Several Gujar castes survive in Gujar&#225;t. Among them are Gujar V&#225;ni&#225;s or traders, Gujar Sut&#225;rs or carpenters, Gujar Sonis or goldsmiths, Gujar Kumbh&#225;rs or potters, and Gujar Sal&#225;ts or masons. All of these are Gujars who taking to different callings have formed separate castes. The main Gujar underlayer are the Lew&#225;s and Ka&#7693;w&#225;s the two leading divisions of the important class of Gujar&#225;t Ka&#7751;bis. The word Ka&#7751;bi is from the Sanskrit Ku&#7789;umbin, that is one possessing a family or a house. From ancient times the title Ku&#7789;umbin has been prefixed to the names of cultivators.<note id="n4.2" n="2">Bombay Gazetteer, N&#225;sik, page 604. <abbr expan="Bombay Arch&#230;ological Survey Separate">Bombay Arch. Survey Sep.</abbr> Number X. 38.</note> This practice still obtains in parts of the North-West Provinces where the peasant proprietors are addressed as G&#7771;ihasthas or householders. As cattle-breeding not cultivation was the original as it still is the characteristic calling of many North Indian Gujars, those of the tribe who settled to cultivation came to be specially known as Ku&#7789;umbin or householders. Similarly Deccan surnames show that many tribes of wandering cattle-owners settled as householders and are now known as Kunbis.<note id="n4.3" n="3">Among Deccan Kunbi surnames are J&#225;dhav, Chuh&#225;n, Nikumbha, Parm&#225;r, Sel&#225;r, Solk&#233;. Cf. Bombay Gazetteer, XXIV. 65 note 2, 414.</note> During the last <pb id="pb5" n="5"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter I.</item><item>The Name.</item></list> </fw>twenty years the settlement as Kunbis in Kh&#225;ndesh of tribes of wandering Wanj&#225;ra herdsmen and grain-carriers is an example of the change through which the Gujar&#225;t Kanbis and the Deccan Kunbis passed in early historic times.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Gujars.</note>Besides resembling them in appearance and in their skill both as husbandmen and as cattle-breeders the division of Gujar&#225;t Kanbis into Lewa and Kadwa seems to correspond with the division of M&#225;lwa Gujars into D&#225;ha and <corr sic="Karad">Kar&#225;d</corr>, with the Lewa origin of the East Kh&#225;ndesh Gujars, and with the Lawi tribe of Panj&#225;b Gujars. The fact that the head-quarters of the Lewa Kanbis of Gujar&#225;t is in the central section of the province known as the Charotar and formerly under Valabhi supports the view that the founder of Valabhi power was the chief leader of the Gujar tribe. That nearly a fourth of the whole Hindu population of Gujar&#225;t are Lewa and Kadwa Kanbis and that during the sixth seventh and eighth centuries three Gujar chiefs divided among them the sway of the entire province explain how the province of Gujar&#225;t came to take its name from the tribe of Gujars.<note id="n5.1" n="1">Though the identification of the Valabhis as Gurjjaras may not be certain, in inscriptions noted below both the <corr sic="Ch&#225;vad&#225;s">Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s</corr> and the <corr sic="Solankis">Solan&#775;kis</corr> are called Gurjjara kings. The Gurjjara origin of either or of both these dynasties may be questioned. The name Gurjjara kings may imply no more than that they ruled the Gurjjara country. At the same time it was under the <corr sic="Ch&#225;vad&#225;s">Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s</corr> that Gujar&#225;t got its name. Though to Al Biruni (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1020) Gujar&#225;t still meant part of R&#225;jput&#225;na, between <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;750 and 950 the name Gurjjaras&#8217; land passed as far south as the territory connected with Anhilv&#225;&#7693;a and Va&#7693;nagara that is probably as far as the Mahi.

This southern application is still somewhat incomplete. Even now the people of Surat both Hindus and Musalm&#225;ns when they visit Pattan (Anhilv&#225;&#7693;a) and Ahmadabad speak of going to Gujar&#225;t, and the Ahmad&#225;b&#225;d section of the N&#225;gar Br&#225;hmans still call their Surat caste-brethren by the name of Kunka&#7751;&#225;s that is of the Konka&#7751;.</note>

The first name is fabulous. The city does not seem to have ever been known by so strange a title. Of the two &#193;narttapura and &#193;nandapura the former is the older name, while the latter may be its proper name or perhaps an adaptation of the older name to give the meaning City of Joy. The fourth Vriddha-nagara meaning the old city is a Sanskritized form of the still current Vadnagar, the Old or Great City.

Revata had a hundred sons of whom the eldest was named Raivata or Kakudmi. Raivata had a daughter named Revati who was married to Baladeva of Ku&#347;asthali or Dw&#225;rik&#225;, the elder brother of <corr sic="Krish&#7751;a">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</corr>. Regarding Revati&#8217;s marriage with Baladeva the <corr sic="Pur&#225;nic">Pur&#225;&#7751;ic</corr> legends tell that Raivata went with his daughter to Brahm&#225; in Brahma-loka to take his advice to whom he should give the girl in marriage. When Raivata arrived Brahm&#225; was listening to music. As soon as the music was over Raivata asked Brahm&#225; to find the girl a proper bridegroom. Brahm&#225; told Raivata that during the time he had been waiting his kingdom had passed away, and that he had better marry his daughter to Baladeva, born of <corr sic="Vishnu">Vish&#7751;u</corr>, who was now ruler of Dw&#225;rik&#225;.<note id="n8.1" n="1">The <corr sic="Vishnu">Vish&#7751;u</corr> Pur&#225;na (An&#347;a iv. <abbr>Chap.</abbr> i.

See also Harivan&#347;a, X.</note> This story suggests that Raivata son of &#193;nartta lost his kingdom and fled perhaps by sea. That after some time during which the Y&#225;davas established themselves in the country, Raivata, called a son of Revata but probably a descendant as his proper name is Kakudmi, returned to his old territory and gave his daughter in marriage to one of the reigning Y&#225;dava dynasty, the Y&#225;davas taking the girl as representing the dynasty that had preceded them. The story about Brahm&#225; and the passing of ages seems invented to explain the long period that elapsed between the flight and the return.

According to the <corr sic="Harivansa">Harivan&#347;a</corr> the fugitive Y&#225;davas quitting Mathur&#225; went to the Sindhu country and there established the city of Dw&#225;rik&#225; on a convenient site on the sea shore making it their residence.<note id="n9.2" n="2"><corr sic="Hari-vansa">Harivan&#347;a</corr>, XXXV.&#8211;CXII.</note> Local tradition says that the Y&#225;davas conquered this part of the country by defeating the demons who held it.

 </p><p>The leading Y&#225;dava chief in Dw&#225;rik&#225; was Ugrasena, and Ugrasena&#8217;s three chief supporters were the families of Yadu, Bhoja, and Andhaka. As the entire peninsula of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a was subject to them the Y&#225;davas used often to make pleasure excursions and pilgrimages to Prabh&#225;s and Girn&#225;r. <corr sic="Krish&#7751;a">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</corr> and Baladeva though not yet rulers held high positions and took part in almost all important matters. They were in specially close alliance with their paternal aunt&#8217;s sons the P&#225;ndava brothers, kings of Hastin&#225;pura or Delhi. Of the two sets of cousins <corr sic="Krish&#7751;a">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</corr> and Arjuna were on terms of the closest intimacy. Of one of Arjuna&#8217;s visits to K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a the Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata gives the following details: &#8216;Arjuna after having visited other holy places arrived in Apar&#225;nta (the western seaboard) whence he went to Prabh&#225;s. Hearing of his arrival <corr sic="Krish&#7751;a">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</corr> marched to Prabh&#225;s and gave Arjuna a hearty welcome. From Prabh&#225;s they came together to the Raivataka hill which <corr sic="Krishna">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</corr> had decorated and where he entertained his guest with music and dancing. From Girn&#225;r they went to Dw&#225;rik&#225; driving in a golden car. The city was adorned in honour of Arjuna; the streets were thronged with multitudes; and the members of the Vrish&#7751;i, Bhoja, and Andhaka families met to honour <corr sic="Krish&#7751;a&#8217;s">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a&#8217;s</corr> guest.&#8217;<note id="n9.3" n="3">Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata &#193;diparva, chaps. 218&#8211;221.</note>

 </p><p>Some time after, against his elder brother Baladeva&#8217;s desire, <corr sic="Krish&#7751;a">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</corr> helped Arjuna to carry off <corr sic="Krish&#7751;a&#8217;s">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a&#8217;s</corr> sister Subhadr&#225;, with whom Arjuna had fallen in love at a fair in Girn&#225;r of which the Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata gives the following description: &#8216;A gathering of the Y&#225;davas chiefly the Vrish&#7751;is and Andhakas took place near Raivataka. The hill and the country round were rich with fine rows of fruit trees and large mansions. There was much dancing singing and music. The princes of the Vrish&#7751;i family were in handsome carriages glistening with gold. Hundreds and thousands of the people of Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h with their families attended on foot and in vehicles of various kinds. Baladeva with his wife Revati moved about attended by many Gandharvas. Ugrasena was there with his thousand queens and musicians. S&#225;mba and Pradyumna attended <pb id="pb10" n="10"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter III.</item><item>Legends.</item><item>The Y&#225;davas.</item></list> </fw>in holiday attire and looked like gods. Many Y&#225;davas and others were also present with their wives and musicians.&#8217;

 </p><p>Some time after this gathering Subhadr&#225; came to Girn&#225;r to worship and Arjuna carried her off. Eventually Vasudeva and Baladeva consented and the runaways were married with due ceremony. The large fair still held in M&#225;gh (February-March) in the west Girn&#225;r valley near the modern temple of Bhavan&#225;th is perhaps a relic of this great Y&#225;dava fair.

 </p><p>The Y&#225;dava occupation of Dw&#225;rik&#225; was not free from trouble. When <corr sic="Krish&#7751;a">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</corr> was at Hastin&#225;pura on the occasion of the R&#225;jas&#250;ya sacrifice performed by Yudhish&#7789;hira, &#346;&#225;lva king of <corr sic="M&#7771;ittik&#225;vati">M&#7771;ittik&#225;vat&#237;</corr> in the country of &#346;aubha led an army against Dw&#225;rik&#225;. He slew many of the Dw&#225;rik&#225; garrison, plundered the city and withdrew unmolested. On his return <corr sic="Krish&#7751;a">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</corr> learning of &#346;&#225;lva&#8217;s invasion led an army against &#346;&#225;lva. The chiefs met near the sea shore and in a pitched battle &#346;&#225;lva was defeated and killed.<note id="n10.1" n="1">Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata Vanaparva, <abbr>Chap.</abbr> xiv.&#8211;xxii. Skanda x. <corr sic="M&#7771;ittik&#225;vati">M&#7771;ittik&#225;vat&#237;</corr> the capital of &#346;&#225;lva cannot be identified. The name of the country sounds like &#346;vabhra in Rudrad&#225;man&#8217;s Girn&#225;r inscription, which is apparently part of Charotar or South Ahmadabad. A trace of the old word perhaps remains in the river S&#225;bhramati the modern S&#225;barmati. The fact that &#346;&#225;lva passed from <corr sic="M&#7771;ittik&#225;vati">M&#7771;ittik&#225;vat&#237;</corr> along the sea shore would seem to show that part of the seaboard south of the Mahi was included in &#346;&#225;lva&#8217;s territory. Dr. B&#252;hler (<abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> VII. 263) described Pandit <corr sic="Bhagvanl&#225;l&#8217;s">Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l&#8217;s</corr> reading of &#346;vabhra as a bold conjecture. A further examination of the original convinced the Pandit that &#346;vabhra was the right reading.</note> Family feuds brought Y&#225;dava supremacy in Dw&#225;rik&#225; to a disastrous end. The final family struggle is said to have happened in the thirty-sixth year after the war of the Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata, somewhere on the south coast of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a near Prabh&#225;s or Somn&#225;th P&#225;tan the great place of Br&#225;hmanical pilgrimage. On the occasion of an eclipse, in obedience to a proclamation issued by <corr sic="Krish&#7751;a">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</corr>, the Y&#225;davas and their families went from Dw&#225;rik&#225; to Prabh&#225;s in state well furnished with dainties, animal food, and strong drink. One day on the sea shore the leading Y&#225;dava chiefs heated with wine began to dispute. They passed from words to blows. <corr sic="Krish&#7751;a">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</corr> armed with an iron rod<note id="n10.2" n="2">The following is the legend of <corr sic="Krish&#7751;a&#8217;s">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a&#8217;s</corr> iron flail. Certain Y&#225;dava youths hoping to raise a laugh at the expense of Vi&#347;v&#225;mitra and other sages who had come to Dw&#225;rik&#225; presented to them S&#225;mba <corr sic="Krish&#7751;a&#8217;s">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a&#8217;s</corr> son dressed as a woman big with child. The lads asked the sages to foretell to what the woman would give birth. The sages replied: &#8216;The woman will give birth to an iron rod which will destroy the Y&#225;dava race.&#8217; Obedient to the sage&#8217;s prophecy S&#225;mba produced an iron rod. To avoid the ill effects of the prophecy king Ugrasena had the rod ground to powder and cast the powder into the sea. The powder grew into the grass called <hi>eraka</hi> <foreign lang="la-x-bio" xml:lang="la-x-bio">Typha elephantina</foreign>. It was this grass which <corr sic="Krishna">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</corr> plucked in his rage and which in his hands turned into an iron flail.

 </p><p>In the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, XX. XXI. and XXII. Mr. Hewitt has recently attempted to trace the history of Western India back to <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;3000 perhaps to as early as <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;6000. The evidence which makes so far-reaching a past probable is the discovery of Indian indigo and muslin in Egyptian tombs of about <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;1700 (<abbr expan="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> XX. 206); and the proof that a trade in teak and in Sindhu or Indian muslins existed between Western India and the Euphrates mouth as far back as <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;3000 or even <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;4000 (<abbr expan="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> XX. 336, 337 and XXI. 204). According to Mr. Hewitt the evidence of the Hindu calendar carries the historical past of India into still remoter ages. The moon mansions and certain other details of the Hindu calendar seem to point to the Euphrates valley as the home of Hindu lunar astronomy. As in the Euphrates valley inscriptions of the Semitic king Sargon of Sippara prove that in <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;3750 moon-worship was already antiquated (<abbr expan="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> XXI. 325), and as the precession of the equinoxes points to about <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;4700 as the date of the introduction of the sun zodiac (Sayce&#8217;s Hibbert Lectures, 398) the system of lunar mansions and months, if it came from the Euphrates valley, must have reached India before <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;4700. The trade records of the black-headed perhaps Dravidian-speaking Sumris of the Euphrates mouth prove so close relations with the peninsula of Sinai and Egypt as to make a similar connection with Western India probable as far back as <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;6000. (Compare Sayce&#8217;s Hibbert Lectures, 33: <abbr expan="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> XXI. 326.) Of the races of whose presence in Gujar&#225;t and the neighbourhood Mr. Hewitt finds traces the earliest is the same black-headed moon-worshipping Sumri (Ditto). Next from Susiana in south-east Persia, the possessors of a lunar-solar calendar and therefore not later than <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;4700 (<abbr expan="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> XXI. 325, 327, 330), the trading Sus or Saus, in Hindu books known as Suvarnas, entered India by way of Baluchist&#225;n and settled at P&#225;tala in South Sindh. (<abbr expan="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> XXI. 209.) With or soon after the Sus came from the north the cattle-herding sun-worshipping Sakas (<abbr expan="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> XXII. 332). The Sus and Sakas passed south and together settled in <corr sic="Surashtra">Sur&#225;sh&#7789;ra</corr> and West Gujar&#225;t. At a date which partly from evidence connected with the early Vedic hymns (<abbr expan="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> XXII. 466) partly from the early Babylonian use of the Sanskrit Sindhu for India (<abbr expan="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> XXI. 309), Mr. Hewitt holds cannot be later than <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;3000 northern &#193;ryas entered Gujar&#225;t and mixing with the Sus and Sakas as ascetics traders and soldiers carried the use of Sanskrit southwards. (<abbr expan="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> XX. 343.) Of other races who held sway in Gujar&#225;t the earliest, perhaps about <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;2000 since their power was shattered by Para&#347;ur&#225;ma long before Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata times (<abbr expan="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> XXI. 209&#8211;266), were the snake-worshipping perhaps Accadian (Ditto, 265) Haihayas now represented by the Gonds and the Haihayas&#8217; vassals the Vaidarbhas (Ditto, 209) a connection which is supported by trustworthy Central Indian Uraon or Gond tradition that they once held Gujar&#225;t (Elliott&#8217;s Races, N. W. P., I. 154). Next to the Haihayas and like them earlier than the Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata (say <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;1500&#8211;2000) Mr. Hewitt would place the widespread un-Aryan Bh&#225;rats or Bh&#225;rgavs (<abbr expan="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> XXI. 279&#8211;282, 286) the conquerors of the Haihayas (Ditto, 288). In early Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata times (say between <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;1000 and 800, Ditto 197 and 209) the Bh&#225;rats were overcome by the very mixed race of the Bhojas and of <corr sic="Krish&#7751;a&#8217;s">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a&#8217;s</corr> followers the Vrish&#7751;is (Ditto, 270). Perhaps about the same time the chariot-driving Gandharvas of Cutch (Ditto, 273) joined the Sus and Sakas, together passed east to Kosala beyond Benares, and were there established in strength at the time of Gautama Buddha (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;530) (Ditto). To the later Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata times, perhaps about <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;400 (Ditto, 197&#8211;271), Mr. Hewitt would assign the entrance into Gujar&#225;t of the &#193;bh&#237;ras or Ahirs whom he identifies with the northern or <pb/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter III.</item><item>Legends.</item><item>The Y&#225;davas.</item></list> </fw>Skythian Ab&#225;rs. Mr. Hewitt finds the following places in Gujar&#225;t associated with those early races. P&#225;t&#225;la in South Sindh he (<abbr expan="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> XXI. 209) considers the head-quarters of the Sus and Sakas. Another Su capital Pr&#225;gjyotisha which is generally allotted to Bengal he would (XXI. 206) identify with Broach. With the Vaidarbhas the vassals of the Haihayas he associates Surparika, that is <corr sic="Sopara">Sop&#225;ra</corr> near Bassein, which he identifies (Ditto, 206) with the modern Surat on the Tapti. He connects (Ditto, 266) the Baroda river Vi&#347;v&#225;mitra and Vaidurga the hill <corr sic="P&#225;v&#225;gad">P&#225;v&#225;ga&#7693;</corr> with the same tribe. He finds a trace of the Bh&#225;rats in Baroda and in Bharati an old name of the river Mahi (Ditto, 286) and of the same race under their name Bh&#225;rgav in Broach (Ditto, 289). The traditional connection of the Bhojas with Dw&#225;rka is well established. Finally K&#225;rp&#225;sika a Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata name for the shore of the Gulf of Cambay (Ditto, 209) may be connected with K&#225;rv&#225;n on the Narbada about twenty miles above Broach one of the holiest Shaiv places in India. Though objection may be taken to certain of Mr. Hewitt&#8217;s identifications of Gujar&#225;t places, and also to the extreme antiquity he would assign to the trade between India and the west and to the introduction of the system of lunar mansions, his comparison of sacred Hindu books with the calendar and ritual of early Babylonia is of much interest.</p></note>

It is further possible that these foreign settlers may have been rulers. In spite of these possibilities we have no traditions between the fall of the Y&#225;davas and the rise of the Mauryas in <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;319.

 </p><p>Gujar&#225;t history dates from the rule of the Mauryan dynasty, the only early Indian dynasty the record of whose rule has been preserved in the writings of the Br&#225;hmans, the Buddhists, and the Jains. This fulness of reference to the Mauryas admits of easy explanation. The Mauryas were a very powerful dynasty whose territory extended over the greater part of India. Again under Mauryan rule Buddhism was so actively propagated that the rulers made it their state religion, waging bloody wars, even revolutionizing many parts of the empire to secure its spread. Further the Mauryas were beneficent rulers and had also honourable alliances with foreign, especially with Greek and Egyptian, kings. These causes combined to make the Mauryans a most powerful and well remembered dynasty.

 </p><p>Inscriptions give reason to believe that the supremacy of Chandragupta, the founder of the Mauryan dynasty (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;319), extended over Gujar&#225;t. According to Rudrad&#225;man&#8217;s inscription (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;150) on the great edict rock at Girn&#225;r in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a, a lake called Sudar&#347;ana<note id="n13.3" n="3">Bombay Branch Royal Asiatic Society Journal, 1891, page 47.</note> near the edict rock was originally made by Pushyagupta of the Vai&#347;ya caste, who is described as a brother-in-law of the Mauryan king Chandragupta.<note id="n13.4" n="4">It is interesting to note that Chandragupta married a Vai&#347;ya lady. Similarly while at S&#225;nchi on his way to Ujjain A&#347;oka married Dev&#237;, the daughter of a Setthi, Turnour&#8217;s <corr sic="Mah&#225;vanso">Mah&#225;wanso</corr>, 76; Cunningham&#8217;s Bhilsa Topes, 95.</note> The language of this inscription leaves no doubt that Chandragupta&#8217;s sway extended over <pb id="pb14" n="14"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter IV.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Mauryas.</hi> <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;319&#8211;197.</item></list> </fw>Girn&#225;r as Pushyagupta is simply called a Vai&#347;ya and a brother-in-law of king Chandragupta and has no royal attribute, particulars which tend to show that he was a local governor subordinate to king Chandragupta. The same inscription<note id="n14.1" n="1">Probably from some mistake of the graver&#8217;s the text of the inscription <foreign lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">&#2309;&#2358;&#2379;&#2325;&#2360;&#2381;&#2351; &#2340;&#2375; &#2351;&#2357;&#2344;&#2352;&#2366;&#2332;&#2375;&#2344;</foreign> yields no meaning. Some word for governor or officer is apparently meant.</note> states that in the time of A&#347;oka (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;250) his officer Yavanar&#225;ja Tush&#225;spa adorned the same Sudar&#347;ana lake with conduits. This would seem to prove the continuance of Mauryan rule in Girn&#225;r for three generations from Chandragupta to A&#347;oka. Tush&#225;spa is called Yavanar&#225;ja. The use of the term <hi>r&#225;ja</hi> would seem to show that, unlike Chandragupta&#8217;s Vai&#347;ya governor Pushyagupta, <corr sic="Tus&#225;shpa">Tush&#225;spa</corr> was a dignitary of high rank and noble family. That he is called Yavanar&#225;ja does not prove Tush&#225;spa was a Greek, though for Greeks alone Yavana is the proper term. The name Tush&#225;spa rather suggests a Persian origin from its close likeness in formation to Kersh&#225;shp, a name still current among Bombay P&#225;rsis. Evidence from other sources proves that A&#347;oka held complete sway over M&#225;lwa, Gujar&#225;t, and the Konkan coast. All the rock edicts of A&#347;oka hitherto traced have been found on the confines of his great empire. On the north-west at Kapurdigiri and at Shabazgarhi in the Baktro-P&#225;li character; in the north-north-west at K&#225;lsi, in the east at Dhauli and Jangada; in the west at Girn&#225;r and Sop&#225;ra, and in the south in Maisur all in Maurya characters. The Girn&#225;r and Sop&#225;ra edicts leave no doubt that the Gujar&#225;t, K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a, and North Konkan seaboard was in A&#347;oka&#8217;s possession. The fact that an inland ruler holds the coast implies his supremacy over the intervening country. Further it is known that A&#347;oka was viceroy of M&#225;lwa in the time of his father and that after his father&#8217;s death he was sovereign of M&#225;lwa. The easy route from Mandasor (better known as Da&#347;apur) to Dohad has always secured a close connection between M&#225;lwa and Gujar&#225;t. South Gujar&#225;t lies at the mercy of any invader entering by Dohad and the conquest of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a on one side and of Upper Gujar&#225;t on the other might follow in detail. As we know that K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a and South Gujar&#225;t as far as Sop&#225;ra were held by A&#347;oka it is not improbable that Upper Gujar&#225;t also owned his sway. The Maurya capital of Gujar&#225;t seems to have been Girinagara or <corr sic="Jun&#225;gadh">Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h</corr> in Central K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a, whose strong hill fort dominating the rich province of Sorath and whose lofty hills a centre of worship and a defence and retreat from invaders, combined to secure for <corr sic="Jun&#225;gadh">Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h</corr> its continuance as capital under the Kshatrapas (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;100&#8211;380) and their successors the Guptas (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;380&#8211;460). The southern capital of the Mauryas seems to have been Sop&#225;ra near Bassein in a rich country with a good and safe harbour for small vessels, probably in those times the chief centre of the Konkan and South Gujar&#225;t trade.

 </p><p>Buddhist and Jain records agree that A&#347;oka was succeeded, not by his son Kun&#225;la who was blind, but by his grandsons Da&#347;aratha and Samprati. The Bar&#225;bar hill near Gay&#225; has caves made by A&#347;oka and bearing his inscriptions; and close to Bar&#225;bar is the <pb id="pb15" n="15"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter IV.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Mauryas.</hi> <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;319&#8211;197.</item></list> </fw>N&#225;g&#225;rjuna hill with caves made by Da&#347;aratha also bearing his inscriptions. In one of these inscriptions the remark occurs that one of the Bar&#225;bar caves was made by Da&#347;aratha &#8216;installed immediately after.&#8217; As the caves in the neighbouring hill must have been well known to have been made by A&#347;oka this &#8216;after&#8217; may mean after A&#347;oka, or the &#8216;after&#8217; may refer solely to the sequence between Da&#347;aratha&#8217;s installation and his excavation of the cave. In any case it is probable that Da&#347;aratha was A&#347;oka&#8217;s successor. Jaina records pass over Da&#347;aratha and say that A&#347;oka was succeeded by his grandson Samprati the son of Kun&#225;la. In the matter of the propagation of the Jain faith, Jain records speak as highly of Samprati as Buddhist records speak of A&#347;oka.<note id="n15.1" n="1">Hemachandra&#8217;s Parisishta Parva.

Though we have no specific information on the point, it is probable, especially as he held M&#225;lwa, that during the reign of Samprati Gujar&#225;t remained under Mauryan sway. With Samprati Mauryan rule in Gujar&#225;t seems to end. In later times (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;500) traces of Mauryan chiefs appear in M&#225;lwa and in the North Konkan. The available details will be given in another chapter.

 </p><p>After Samprati, whose reign ended about <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;197, a blank of seventeen years occurs in Gujar&#225;t history. The next available information shows traces of Baktrian-Greek sway over parts of Gujar&#225;t. In his description of Surastrene or <corr sic="Surashtra">Sur&#225;sh&#7789;ra</corr> the author of the Periplus (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;240) says: &#8216;In this part there are preserved even to this day memorials of the expedition of Alexander, old temples, foundations of camps, and large wells.&#8217;<note id="n15.3" n="3">McCrindle&#8217;s Periplus, 115. The author of the Periplus calls the capital of Surastrene Minnagara. Pandit <corr sic="Bhagvanl&#225;l">Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l</corr> believed Minnagara to be a miswriting of Girinagara the form used for Girn&#225;r both in Rudrad&#225;man&#8217;s (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;150) rock inscription at Girn&#225;r (Fleet&#8217;s <abbr>Corpus Ins.

The mention of a Minagara in Ptolemy inland from Sorath and Monoglossum or Mangrul suggests that either <corr sic="Girnar">Girn&#225;r</corr> or <corr sic="Junaga&#7693;h">Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h</corr> was also known as Minnagara either after the Mins or after Men that is Menander. At the same time it is possible that Ptolemy&#8217;s Agrinagara though much out of place may be Girinagara and that Ptolemy&#8217;s Minagara in the direction of Ujjain may be Mandasor.</note> As Alexander did not <pb id="pb16" n="16"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter IV.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Greeks. <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;180&#8211;100.</hi></item></list> </fw>come so far south as K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a and as after Alexander&#8217;s departure the Mauryas held K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a till about <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;197, it may be suggested that the temples camps and wells referred to by the author of the Periplus were not memorials of the expedition of Alexander but remains of later Baktrian-Greek supremacy.

 </p><p>Demetrius, whom Justin calls the king of the Indians, is believed to have reigned from <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;190 to <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;165.<note id="n16.1" n="1">Justin&#8217;s date is probably about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;250. His work is a summary of the History of Trogus Pompeius about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1. Watson&#8217;s Justin, 277; Wilson&#8217;s Ariana Antiqua, 231.</note> On the authority of Apollodorus of Artamita Strabo (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;50&#8211;<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;20) names two Baktrian-Greek rulers who seem to have advanced far into inland India. He says: &#8216;The Greeks who occasioned the revolt of Baktria (from Syria <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;256) were so powerful by the fertility and advantages of the country that they became masters of Ariana and India.... Their chiefs, particularly Menander, conquered more nations than Alexander. Those conquests were achieved partly by Menander and partly by Demetrius son of Euthydemus king of the Baktrians. They got possession not only of Pattalene but of the kingdoms of Saraostus and Sigerdis, which constitute the remainder of the coast.&#8217;<note id="n16.2" n="2">Hamilton and Falconer&#8217;s Strabo, II. 252&#8211;253.</note> Pattalene is generally believed to be the old city of P&#225;t&#225;l in Sindh (the modern Haidar&#225;b&#225;d), while the subsequent mention of Saraostus and Sigerdis as kingdoms which constitute the remainder of the coast, leaves almost no doubt that Saraostus is <corr sic="Sur&#225;shtra">Sur&#225;sh&#7789;ra</corr> and Sigerdis is S&#225;garadv&#237;pa or Cutch. The joint mention of Menander (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;126) and Demetrius (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;190) may mean that Demetrius advanced into inland India to a certain point and that Menander passed further and took Sindh, Cutch, and K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a. The discovery in Cutch and K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a of coins of Baktrian kings supports the statements of Justin and Strabo. Dr. <corr sic="Bhagvanl&#225;l&#8217;s">Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l&#8217;s</corr> collecting of coins in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a and Gujar&#225;t during nearly twenty-five years brought to light among Baktrian-Greek coins an obolus of Eucratides (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;180&#8211;155), a few drachm&#230; of Menander (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;126&#8211;110), many drachm&#230; and copper coins of Apollodotus (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;110&#8211;100), but none of Demetrius. Eucratides was a contemporary of Demetrius. Still, as Eucratides became king of Baktria after Demetrius, his conquests, according to Strabo of a thousand cities to the east of the Indus, must be later than those of Demetrius.

 </p><p>As his coins are found in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a Eucratides may either have advanced into K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a or the province may have come under his sway as lord of the neighbouring country of Sindh. Whether or not Eucratides conquered the province, he is the earliest Baktrian-Greek king whose coins have been found in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a and Gujar&#225;t. The fact that the coins of Eucratides have been found in different parts of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a and at different times seems to show that they were the currency of the province and were not merely imported either for trade or for ornament. It is to be noticed that these coins are all of the smallest value of the numerous coins issued by Eucratides. This may be explained by the fact that these small <pb id="pb17" n="17"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter IV.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Greeks. <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;180&#8211;100.</hi></item></list> </fw>coins were introduced by Eucratides into K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a to be in keeping with the existing local coinage. The local silver coins in use before the time of Eucratides are very small, weighing five to seven grains, and bear the Buddhist symbols of the Svastika, the Trident, and the Wheel. Another variety has been found weighing about four grains with a misshapen elephant on the obverse and something like a circle on the reverse.<note id="n17.1" n="1">These small local coins which were found in H&#225;l&#225;r Gondal were presented to the Bombay Asiatic Society by the Political Agent of K&#225;thi&#225;w&#225;r and are in the Society&#8217;s cabinet.

 </p><p>The end of the reign of Eucratides is not fixed with certainty: it is believed to be about <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;155.<note id="n17.2" n="2">Wilson&#8217;s Ariana Antiqua, 266.

As already noticed Strabo (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;20) mentions that Menander&#8217;s conquests (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;120) included Cutch and <corr sic="Sur&#225;shtra">Sur&#225;sh&#7789;ra</corr>.<note id="n17.3" n="3">See above page <ref type="pageref" target="pb15">15</ref>.</note> And the author of the Periplus (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;240) writes: &#8216;Up to the present day old drachm&#230; bearing the Greek inscriptions of Apollodotus and Menander are current in Barugaza (Broach).&#8217;<note id="n17.4" n="4">McCrindle&#8217;s Periplus, 121.</note> Menander&#8217;s silver drachm&#230; have been found in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a and Southern Gujar&#225;t.<note id="n17.5" n="5">The Bombay Asiatic Society possesses some specimens of these coins of bad workmanship found near Broach with the legend incorrect, probably struck by some local governor of Menander.

The distribution of Menander&#8217;s coins suggests he was the first Baktrian-Greek king who resided in these parts and that the monuments of Alexander&#8217;s times, camps temples and wells, mentioned by the author of the Periplus<note id="n17.6" n="6">McCrindle&#8217;s Periplus, 115.</note> were camps of Menander in <corr sic="Sur&#225;shtra">Sur&#225;sh&#7789;ra</corr>. Wilson and Rochette have supposed Apollodotus to be the son and successor of Menander,<note id="n17.7" n="7">Numismatic Chronicle (New Series), X. 80; Wilson&#8217;s Ariana Antiqua, 288.</note> while General Cunningham believes Apollodotus to be the predecessor of Menander.<note id="n17.8" n="8">Numismatic Chronicle (New Series), X, 80.</note> Inferences from the coins of these two kings found in Gujar&#225;t and K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a support the view that Apollodotus was the successor of Menander. The coins of Apollodotus are found in much larger numbers than those of Menander and the workmanship of Apollodotus&#8217; coins appears to be of a gradually declining style. In the later coins the legend is at times undecipherable. It appears from this that for some time after Apollodotus until Nahap&#225;na&#8217;s (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;100) coins came into use, the chief local currency was debased coins struck after the type of the coins of Apollodotus. Their use as the type of coinage generally happens to the coins of the last king of a dynasty. The statement by the author of the Periplus that in his time (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;240) the old drachm&#230; of Apollodotus and Menander were <pb id="pb18" n="18"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter IV.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Greeks. <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;180&#8211;100.</hi></item></list> </fw>current in Barugaza, seems to show that these drachm&#230; continued to circulate in Gujar&#225;t along with the coins of the Western Kshatrapas. The mention of Apollodotus before Menander by the author of the Periplus may either be accidental, or it may be due to the fact that when the author wrote fewer coins of Menander than of Apollodotus were in circulation.

 </p><p>The silver coins both of Menander and Apollodotus found in Gujar&#225;t and K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a are of only one variety, round drachm&#230;. The reason that of their numerous large coins, tetradrachm&#230; didrachm&#230; and others, drachm&#230; alone have been found in Gujar&#225;t is probably the reason suggested for the introduction of the obolus of Eucratides, namely that the existing local currency was so poor that coins of small value could alone circulate. Still the fact that drachm&#230; came into use implies some improvement in the currency, chiefly in size. The drachm&#230; of both the kings are alike. The obverse of Menander&#8217;s coins has in the middle a helmeted bust of the king and round it the Greek legend <choice><orig><foreign lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#914;&#913;&#931;&#921;&#923;&#917;&#937;&#931; &#931;&#937;&#932;&#919;&#929;&#927;&#931; &#924;&#917;&#925;&#913;&#925;&#916;&#929;&#927;&#933;</foreign></orig><reg type="trans"><foreign lang="grc-latn" xml:lang="grc-latn">BASILE&#332;S S&#332;T&#274;ROS MENANDROY</foreign></reg></choice> Of the king the Saviour Menander.

The only fact that breaks this blank in Gujar&#225;t history is the discovery of copper coins of a king whose name is not known, but who calls himself Basileus Basileon Soter Megas that is King of Kings the Great Saviour. These coins are found in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a and Cutch as well as in R&#225;jput&#225;na the North-West Provinces and the K&#225;bul valley, a distribution which points to a widespread Indian rule. The suggestion may be offered that this king is one of the leaders of the Yaudheyas whose constitution is said to have been tribal, that is the tribe was ruled by a number of small chiefs who would not be likely to give their names on their coins.<note id="n19.3" n="3">Wilson (Ariana Antiqua, 332&#8211;334) identifies the coins marked Basileus Basileon Soter Megas with a king or dynasty of Indian extraction who reigned between Azes and Kadphises (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;50&#8211;25), chiefly in the Panj&#225;b.

But the marked difference between the Stag coins of the Yaudheyas (Thomas&#8217; Prinsep, I.

Till recently this dynasty was known to orientalists as the S&#225;h dynasty a mistaken reading of the terminal of their names which in some rulers is Sim&#803;ha Lion and in others, as in Rudra Sena (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;203&#8211;220) son of Rudra Sim&#803;ha, Sena Army.<note id="n20.1" n="1"><p>Journal Bengal Asiatic Society (1835), 684; (1837), 351; (1838), 346; Thomas&#8217; Prinsep&#8217;s Indian Antiquities, I. 425&#8211;435, II. 84&#8211;93; Thomas in Journal Royal Asiatic Society (Old Series), XII. 1&#8211;72; Wilson&#8217;s Ariana Antiqua, 405&#8211;413; Journal <abbr expan="Bombay Branch Royal Asiatic Society">B.

 </p><p>The dynasty of the Kshatrapas or Mah&#225;kshatrapas of <corr sic="Saur&#225;shtra">Saur&#225;sh&#7789;ra</corr> was known to Prinsep (<abbr expan="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> Bl. VII.&#8211;1. (1837), 351) to Thomas (<abbr expan="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> <abbr expan="First Series">F. S.</abbr> XII. 1&#8211;78), and to Newton (<abbr expan="Journal Bombay Branch Royal Asiatic Society">Jl. B. B. R. A. S.</abbr> IX. 1&#8211;19) as the Sah or S&#226;h kings. More recently, from the fact that the names of some of them end in Sena or army, the Kshatrapas have been called the Sena kings. The origin of the title Sah is the ending <hi>siha</hi>, that is <hi>sim&#803;ha</hi> lion, which belongs to the names of several of the kings. <hi>S&#237;ha</hi> has been read either <hi>s&#225;h</hi> or <hi>sena</hi> because of the practice of omitting from the die vowels which would fall on or above the top line of the legend and also of omitting the short vowel <hi>i</hi> with the following <hi>anusv&#225;ra</hi>. S&#225;h is therefore a true reading of the writing on certain of the coins. That the form S&#225;h on these coins is not the correct form has been ascertained from stone inscriptions in which freedom from crowding makes possible the complete cutting of the above-line marks. In stone inscriptions the ending is <hi>s&#237;ha</hi> lion. See Fleet&#8217;s <foreign lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum</foreign>, III. 36 note 1. Mr. Fleet (Ditto) seems to suggest that with the proof of the incorrectness of the reading S&#225;h the evidence that the Kshatrapas were of Indo-Skythian origin ceases. This does not seem to follow. In addition to the Parthian title Kshatrapa, their northern coinage, and the use of the &#346;aka (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;78) era, now accepted as the accession of the great Kush&#225;n Kanishka, the evidence in the text shows that the line of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a Kshatrapas starts from the foreigner Chash&#7789;ana (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;130) whose predecessor Nah&#225;pana (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;120) and his &#346;aka son-in-law Ushavadatta are noted in N&#225;sik inscriptions (N&#225;sik Gazetteer, 538 and 621) as leaders of &#346;akas, Palhavas, and Yavanas. Further as the limits of Ptolemy&#8217;s (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;150) Indo-Skythia (McCrindle, 136) agree very closely with the limits of the dominions of the then ruling Mah&#225;kshatrapa Rudrad&#225;man (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;150) it follows that Ptolemy or his informer believed Rudrad&#225;man to be an Indo-Skythian. There therefore seems no reasonable doubt that the Kshatrapas were foreigners. According to Cunningham (Num. Chron. VIII. 231) they were &#346;akas who entered Gujar&#225;t from Sindh. The fact that the Kush&#225;n era (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;78) was not adopted by the first two of the Western Kshatrapas, Chash&#7789;ana and Jayad&#225;man, supports the view that they belonged to a wave of northerners earlier than the Kush&#225;n wave.</p></note>

Pt. III. 167) and in some coins of the Northern Kshatrapa kings Pagamasha, R&#225;javula, and Sud&#225;sa found near Mathur&#225;. Prinsep&#8217;s Indian Antiquities, II. Pl. XLIV. Figs. 12, 20, 21.</note> All these forms have the same meaning namely Lord or Protector of the warrior-race, the Sanskrit Kshatra-pa.<note id="n21.4" n="4">Kshatramp&#226;t&#238;ti Kshatrapah&#803;.</note> It is to be noted that the title Kshatrapa appears nowhere as a title of any king or royal officer within the whole range of Sanskrit literature, or indeed on any inscription, coin, or other record of any Indian dynasty except the Northern and the Western Kshatrapas. According to Prinsep Kshatrapa is a Sanskritized form of Satrapa, a term familiar to the Grecian history of ancient Persia and used for the prefect of a province under the Persian system of government. As Prinsep further observes Satrapa had probably the same meaning in Ariana that Kshatrapa had in Sanskrit, the ruler feeder or patron of the <hi>kshatra</hi> or warrior class, the chief of a warlike tribe or clan.<note id="n21.5" n="5">Thomas&#8217; Prinsep, II. 63 and 64.</note> Prinsep further notes the Persian kings were often in need of such chiefs and as they entrusted the chiefs with the government of parts of their dominions the word came to mean a governor. So during the anarchy which prevailed on the Skythian overthrow of Greek rule in Baktria<note id="n21.6" n="6">Malaya or Malava, Pallava, &#193;bh&#237;ra, Meva or Meda, and Mihira or Mehr appear to be the leading warlike tribes who came to India under these chiefs. These tribes formed the Kshatras whose lords or Kshatrapas these chiefs were.</note> (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;160) several chiefs of Malaya, Pallava, &#193;bh&#237;ra, Meda, and other predatory tribes came from Baktria to Upper India, and each established for himself a principality or kingdom. Subsequently these chiefs appear to have assumed independent sovereignty. Still though they often call themselves <hi>r&#225;j&#225;s</hi> or kings with the title Kshatrapa or Mah&#225;kshatrapa, if any Baktrian king advanced towards their territories, they were probably ready to acknowledge him as Overlord. Another reason for believing these Kshatrapa chiefs to have been foreigners is that, while the names of the founders of Kshatrapa sovereignty are foreign, their inscriptions and coins show that soon after the establishment of their rule they became converts to one or other form of the Hindu religion and assumed Indian names.<note id="n21.7" n="7"><p>The explanation of the word Kshatrapa started by Prinsep and accepted by Pandit Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l is of doubtful accuracy. The title is well known in Greek literature in the form <choice><orig><foreign lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#963;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#960;&#951;&#962;</foreign></orig><reg type="trans"><foreign lang="grc-latn" xml:lang="grc-latn">satrap&#275;s</foreign></reg></choice>, and in the form Kshatrap&#225;van occurs twice (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;520) in connection with the governors of Baktria and Arachosia in the great Behistan inscription of Darius (Rawlinson&#8217;s Herodotus, I. 329; Spiegel&#8217;s <foreign lang="de" xml:lang="de">Altpersische Keilinschriften</foreign>, 24&#8211;26). The meaning of Kshatrap&#225;van in old Persian is not &#8220;protector of the Kshatra race&#8221; but &#8220;protector of the kingdom,&#8221; for the word <hi>kshatram</hi> occurs in the inscriptions of the Ach&#230;menid&#230; with the meaning of &#8220;kingship&#8221; or &#8220;kingdom&#8221; (Spiegel, <foreign lang="de" xml:lang="de">Altpersische Keilinschriften</foreign>, 215). As is well known Satrap was the official title of the ruler of a Persian province. That the name continued in use with the same meaning under the Greek kings of Baktria <pb/>(<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;250&#8211;100) is known from Strabo, who says (XI. 11) &#8220;the Greeks who held Baktria divided it into satrapies (<choice><orig><foreign lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#963;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#945;&#962;</foreign></orig><reg type="trans"><foreign lang="grc-latn" xml:lang="grc-latn">satrapeias</foreign></reg></choice>) of which Aspionus and Touriva were taken from Eukratides (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;180) by the Parthians.&#8221; It is to be presumed that the Baktro-Grecians introduced the same arrangement into the provinces which they conquered in India. The earliest occurrence of the title in its Indian form is on the coins of a Rajabula or Ranjabola (Gardner, B. M. Cat. 67), who in his Greek legend makes use of the title &#8220;King of kings,&#8221; and in his Indian legend calls himself &#8220;The unconquered Chhatrapa.&#8221; His adoption for the reverse of his coins of the Athene Promachos type of Menander and Apollodotus Philopator connects Rajabula in time with those kings (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;126&#8211;100) and we know from an inscription (Cunningham Arch. Rep. XX. 48) that he reigned at Mathur&#225;. He was probably a provincial governor who became independent about <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;100 when the Greek kingdom broke up. The above facts go to show that Kshatrapa was originally a Persian title which was adopted by the Greeks and continued in use among their successors: that it originally denoted a provincial governor; but that, when the Greek kingdom broke up and their provincial chiefs became independent, it continued in use as a royal title. That after the Christian era, even in Parthia, the title Satrapes does not necessarily imply subjection to a suzerain is proved by the use of the phrase <choice><orig><foreign lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#963;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#960;&#951;&#962; &#964;&#969;&#957; &#963;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#960;&#969;&#957;</foreign></orig><reg type="trans"><foreign lang="grc-latn" xml:lang="grc-latn">satrap&#275;s t&#333;n satrap&#333;n</foreign></reg></choice> Satrap of Satraps, with the sense of King of Kings in Gotarzes&#8217; Behistan inscription of <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;50.

 </p><p>The Pandit&#8217;s identification of the Malavas or Malayas with a northern or Skythian tribe is in agreement with Alberuni (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1015), who, on the authority of the B&#225;j Pur&#225;na (Sachau&#8217;s Text, <abbr>chap.</abbr> 29 page 150&#8211;155) groups as northern tribes the Pallavas, &#346;akas, Mallas, and Gurjars. In spite of this authority it seems better to identify the Mallas, Malavas, or Malayas with Alexander the Great&#8217;s (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;325) Malloi of <corr sic="Multan">Mult&#225;n</corr> (compare McCrindle&#8217;s Alexander&#8217;s Invasion of India, Note P). At the same time (Rockhill&#8217;s Life of Buddha, 132, 133, 137) the importance of the Mallas in Vais&#225;li (between Patn&#225; and Tirh&#250;t) during the lifetime of <corr sic="S&#225;kya">&#346;akya</corr> Muni (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;580) favours the view that several distinct tribes have borne the same or nearly the same name.</p></note>

Maues probably belonged to the &#346;aka tribe of Skythians. If the Maues of the coins may be identified with the Moga of the Taxila plate the date of king Patika in the Taxila plate shows that for about seventy-five years after the death of Maues the date of his accession continued to be the initial year of the dynasty. From their <corr sic="connexion">connection</corr> with the &#346;akas, arriving in India during the reign of the &#346;aka Maues and for nearly three quarters of a century accepting the &#346;aka overlordship, the Kshatrapas, though as noted above their followers were chiefly Malayas, Pallavas, &#193;bh&#237;ras, and Medas, appear to have themselves come to be called &#346;akas and the mention of &#346;aka kings in <corr sic="Pur&#225;nik">Pur&#225;&#7751;ic</corr> and other records seems to refer to them. After lasting for about 150 years the rule of the Northern Kshatrapas seems to have merged in the empire of the great Kush&#225;n Kanishka (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;78).

 </p><p>Though recently found inscriptions and coins show that the Kshatrapas ruled over important parts of India including even a share of the western seaboard, nothing is known regarding them from either Indian or foreign literary sources. What little information can be gleaned is from their own inscriptions and coins. Of the Northern Kshatrapas this information is imperfect and disconnected. It shows that they had probably three or four ruling branches, one in the K&#225;bul valley, a second at Taxila near Attak on the North-West <corr sic="Panjab">Panj&#225;b</corr> frontier, a third at Beh&#225;t near Sah&#225;ranpur or Delhi, and a fourth at Mathur&#225;. The last two were perhaps subdivisions of one kingdom; but probably those at K&#225;bul and at Taxila were distinct dynasties. An inscription found <pb id="pb23" n="23"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter V.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Northern Kshatrapas, <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;70&#8211;<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;78.</hi></item></list> </fw>in Mathur&#225; shows a connection either by marriage or by neighbourhood between the Beh&#225;t and Mathur&#225; branches. This is a Baktro-P&#225;li inscription recording the gift of a st&#250;pa by Nandasirik&#225; daughter of Kshatrapa R&#225;javula and mother of Kharaosti Yuvar&#225;ja. Kharaosti is the dynastic name of the prince, his personal name appears later in the inscription as Talama (Ptolemy&#160;?). From his dynastic name, whose crude form Kharaosta or Kharaottha may be the origin of the Prakrit Chhahar&#225;ta and the Sanskritised Kshahar&#225;ta, this Talama appears to be a descendant of the Kshatrapa Kharaosti whose coins found at Taxila call him Artaputa that is the son of Arta apparently the Parthian Ortus.

 </p><p>The same Baktro-P&#225;li Mathur&#225; inscription also mentions with special respect a Kshatrapa named Patika,<note id="n23.1" n="1">Patika was apparently the son of the Liako Kujulako of the Taxila plate. Dowson in <abbr>Jour. R. A. S.</abbr> New Series. IV. 497 mistranslates the inscription and fails to make out the name Patika.</note> who, with the title of Kusulaka or Kozolon, ruled the K&#225;bul valley with his capital first at Nagaraka and later at Taxila.

 </p><p>The same inscription further mentions that the st&#250;pa was given while the Kshatrapa Sud&#225;sa son of the Mah&#225;kshatrapa R&#225;javula was ruling at Mathur&#225;. The inference from the difference in the titles of the father and the son seems to be that Sud&#225;sa was ruling in Mathur&#225; as governor under his father who perhaps ruled in the neighbourhood of Delhi where many of his coins have been found. While the coins of Sud&#225;sa have the legend in N&#225;gar&#237; only, R&#225;javula&#8217;s coins are of two varieties, one with the legend in <corr sic="B&#225;ktro-P&#225;li">Baktro-P&#225;li</corr> and the other with the legend in N&#225;gar&#237;, a fact tending to show that the father&#8217;s territories stretched to the far north.

 </p><p>Though Kharaosti is mentioned as a Yuvar&#225;ja or prince heir-apparent in the time of his maternal uncle Sud&#225;sa, the inscription shows he had four children. It is curious that while the inscription mentions Nandasirik&#225; as the mother of Kharaosti Yuvar&#225;ja, nothing is said about her husband.

No evidence is available to show either that East M&#225;lwa with its capital at Ujjain or that North Gujar&#225;t formed part of his dominions.

The type seems adopted in idea from the drachma of Apollodotus (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;110&#8211;100). On the obverse is a bust with a Greek legend round it and on the reverse a thunderbolt and an arrow probably as on the reverse of the coins of Apollodotus<note id="n24.2" n="2">Some coins of Apollodotus have on the reverse Apollo with his arrow; others have Athene Promachos with the thunderbolt.</note> representing the distinctive weapons of Athene Promachos and of Apollo. In addition to the <corr sic="B&#225;ktro-P&#225;li">Baktro-P&#225;li</corr> legend on the Apollodotus drachma, the reverse of Nahap&#225;na&#8217;s coin has the same legend in N&#225;gar&#237;, since N&#225;gar&#237; was the character of the country for which the coin was struck. The dress of the bust is in the style of the over-dress of Nahap&#225;na&#8217;s time. The bust, facing the right, wears a flat grooved cap and has the hair combed in ringlets falling half down the ear. The neck shows the collar of the coat. The workmanship of the coins is good. The die seems to have been renewed from time to time as the face altered with age. Of Dr. Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l&#8217;s four coins one belongs to Nahap&#225;na&#8217;s youth, another to his old age, and the remaining two to his intervening years. In all four specimens the Greek legend is imperfect and unreadable. The letters of the Greek legend are of the later period that is like the letters on the coins of the great Skythian king Kadphises I. (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;26). One of the coins shows in the legend the six letters <hi rend="sc">L L O D O-S</hi>. These may be the remains of the name Apollodotus (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;110&#8211;100). Still it is beyond doubt that the letters are later Greek than those on the coins of Apollodotus. Until the legend is found clear on some fresher specimen, it is not possible to say anything further.

His name, as was first suggested by Dr. Bhau D&#225;ji, is Pr&#225;krit for Rishabhadatta. From the many charitable and publicly useful works mentioned in various N&#225;sik and K&#225;rle inscriptions, as made by him in places which apparently formed part of Nahap&#225;na&#8217;s dominions, Ushavad&#225;ta appears to have been a high officer under Nahap&#225;na. As Nahap&#225;na seems to have had no son Ushavad&#225;ta&#8217;s position as son-in-law would be one of special power and influence. Ushavad&#225;ta&#8217;s charitable acts and works of public utility are detailed in N&#225;sik Inscriptions X. XII. and XIV. The charitable acts are the gift of three hundred thousand cows; of gold and of river-side steps at the B&#225;rn&#225;sa or Ban&#225;s river near &#193;bu in North Gujar&#225;t; of sixteen villages to gods and Br&#225;hmans; the feeding of hundreds of thousands of Br&#225;hmans every year; the giving in marriage of eight wives to Br&#225;hmans at Prabh&#225;s in South K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a; the bestowing of thirty-two thousand cocoanut trees in Nanamgola or N&#225;rgol village on the Th&#225;na seaboard on the Charaka priesthoods of Pin&#7693;itak&#225;va&#7693;a, Govardhana near N&#225;sik, Suvar&#7751;amukha, and R&#225;mat&#237;rtha in Sorp&#225;raga or Sop&#225;ra on the Th&#225;na coast; the giving of three hundred thousand cows and a village at Pushkara or Pokhar near Ajmir in East <corr sic="Rajput&#225;na">R&#225;jput&#225;na</corr>; making gifts to Br&#225;hmans at Chechi&#7751;a or Chichan near Kelva-M&#225;him on the Th&#225;na coast; and the gift of trees and 70,000 <hi>k&#225;rsh&#225;pa&#7751;as</hi> or 2000 <hi>suvar&#7751;as</hi> to gods and Br&#225;hmans at D&#225;h&#225;nu in Th&#225;na. The public works executed by Ushavad&#225;ta include rest-houses and alms-houses at Bharu Kachha or Broach, at Da&#347;apura or Mandasor in North M&#225;lwa, and gardens and wells at Govardhana and Sop&#225;ra; free ferries across the Ib&#225; or Ambik&#225;, the P&#225;r&#225;da or P&#225;r, the Daman&#225; or Damanganga, the T&#225;pi or T&#225;pti, the Karaben&#225; or K&#225;veri, and the D&#225;h&#225;nuk&#225; or D&#225;h&#225;nu river. Waiting-places and steps were also built on both banks of each of these rivers. These charitable and public works of Ushavad&#225;ta savour much of the Br&#225;hmanic religion.

Ushavad&#225;ta himself thus seems to have been a follower of the Br&#225;hmanical faith. The Buddhist charities were probably made to meet the wishes of his wife whose father&#8217;s religion the Buddhist wheel and the Bodhi tree on his copper coins prove to have been Buddhism. The large territory over which these charitable and public works of Ushavad&#225;ta spread gives an idea of the extent of Nahap&#225;na&#8217;s rule. The gift of a village as far north as Pokhara near Ajmir would have been proof of dominion in those parts were it not for the fact that in the same inscription Ushavad&#225;ta mentions his success in assisting some local Kshatriyas. It is doubtful if the northern limits of Nahap&#225;na&#8217;s dominions extended as far as Pokhar. The village may have been given during a brief conquest, since according to Hindu ideas no village given to Br&#225;hmans can be resumed. The eastern boundary would seem to have been part of M&#225;lwa and the plain lands of Kh&#225;ndesh N&#225;sik and Poona; the southern boundary was somewhere about Bombay; and the western K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a and the Arabian sea.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Nahap&#225;na&#8217;s Era.</note>Nahap&#225;na&#8217;s exact date is hard to fix. Ushavad&#225;ta&#8217;s N&#225;sik cave Inscriptions X. and XII. give the years 41 and 42; and an inscription of Nahap&#225;na&#8217;s minister Ay&#225;ma at Junnar gives the year 46. The era is not mentioned. They are simply dated <hi>vase</hi> Sk. <hi>varshe</hi> that is in the year. Ushavad&#225;ta&#8217;s N&#225;sik Inscription XII. records in the year 42 the gift of charities and the construction of public works which must have taken years to complete. If at that time Ushavad&#225;ta&#8217;s age was 40 to 45, Nahap&#225;na who, as Inscription X. shows, was living at that time, must have been some twenty years older than his son-in-law or say about 65. The Junnar inscription of his minister Ay&#225;ma which bears date 46 proves that Nahap&#225;na lived several years after the making of Ushavad&#225;ta&#8217;s cave. The bust on one of his coins also shows that Nahap&#225;na attained a ripe old age.

 </p><p>Nahap&#225;na cannot have lived long after the year 46. His death may be fixed about the year 50 of the era to which the three years 41, 42, and 46 belong. He was probably about 75 years old when he died. Deducting 50 from 75 we get about 25 as Nahap&#225;na&#8217;s age at the beginning of the era to which the years 41, 42, and 46 belong, a suitable age for an able prince with good resources and good advisers to have established a kingdom. It is therefore probable that the era marks Nahap&#225;na&#8217;s conquest of Gujar&#225;t. As said above, Nahap&#225;na was probably considered to belong to the &#346;aka tribe, and his son-in-law clearly calls himself a &#346;aka. It may therefore be supposed that the era started by Nahap&#225;na on his conquest of Gujar&#225;t was at first simply called Varsha; that it afterwards came to be called &#346;akavarsha or &#346;akasam&#803;vatsara; and that finally, after various changes, to suit false current ideas, about the eleventh or twelfth century the people of the Deccan styled it &#346;&#225;liv&#225;hana Saka mixing it with current traditions regarding the great <corr sic="&#346;&#225;tavahana">&#346;&#225;tav&#225;hana</corr> or &#346;aliv&#225;hana king of Paithan. If, as mentioned above, Nahap&#225;na&#8217;s conquest of Gujar&#225;t and the establishment of his era be taken to come close after the conquest of Mathur&#225; by <pb id="pb27" n="27"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter V.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Western Kshatrapas, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;70&#8211;398.</hi></item><item>Nahap&#225;na&#8217;s Era.</item></list> </fw>Kanishka, the Gujar&#225;t conquest and the era must come very shortly after the beginning of Kanishka&#8217;s reign, since Kanishka conquered Mathur&#225; early in his reign. As his Mathur&#225; inscriptions<note id="n27.1" n="1">Cunningham&#8217;s Arch. Sur. III. Plate 13. Inscriptions 2 and 3.</note> give 5 as Kanishka&#8217;s earliest date, he must have conquered Mathur&#225; in the year 3 or 4 of his reign. Nahap&#225;na&#8217;s expedition to and conquest of Gujar&#225;t was probably contemporary with or very closely subsequent to Kanishka&#8217;s conquest of Mathur&#225;. So two important eras seem to begin about four years apart, the one with Kanishka&#8217;s reign in Upper India, the other with Nahap&#225;na&#8217;s reign in Western India. The difference being so small and both being eras of foreign conquerors, a Kush&#225;n and a &#346;aka respectively, the two eras seem to have been subsequently confounded. Thus, according to Dr. Burnell, the Javanese &#346;aka era is <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;74, that is Kanishka&#8217;s era was introduced into Java, probably because Java has from early times been connected with the eastern parts of India where Kanishka&#8217;s era was current. On the other hand the astrological works called Kara&#7751;a use the era beginning with <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;78 which we have taken to be the Western era started by Nahap&#225;na. The use of the &#346;aka era in Kara&#7751;a works dates from the time of the great Indian astronomer Var&#225;ha Mihira (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;587). As Var&#225;ha Mihira lived and wrote his great work in Avanti or M&#225;lwa he naturally made use of the &#346;aka era of Nahap&#225;na, which was current in M&#225;lwa. Subsequent astronomers adopted the era used by the master Var&#225;ha Mihira. Under their influence Nahap&#225;na&#8217;s <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;78 era passed into use over the whole of Northern and Central India eclipsing Kanishka&#8217;s <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;74 era. On these grounds it may be accepted that the dates in the N&#225;sik inscriptions of Ushavad&#225;ta and in Ay&#225;ma&#8217;s inscription at Junnar are in the era founded by Nahap&#225;na on his conquest of Gujar&#225;t and the West Deccan. This era was adopted by the Western Kshatrapa successors of Nahap&#225;na and continued on their coins for nearly three centuries.<note id="n27.2" n="2">The author&#8217;s only reason for supposing that two eras began between <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;70 and 80 seems to be the fact that the Javanese &#346;aka era begins <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;74, while the Indian &#346;aka era begins <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;78. It appears, however, from Lassen&#8217;s Ind. Alt. II. 1040 note 1, that the Javanese &#346;aka era begins either in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;74 or in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;78. The author&#8217;s own authority, Dr. Burnell (<abbr>S. Ind. Pal.</abbr> 72) while saying that the Javanese &#346;aka era dates from <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;74, gives <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;80 as the epoch of the &#346;aka era of the neighbouring island of Bali, thus supporting Raffle&#8217;s explanation (Java, II. 68) that the difference is due to the introduction into Java of the Muhammadan mode of reckoning during the past 300 years. The Javanese epoch of <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;74 cannot therefore be treated as an authority for assuming a genuine Indian era with this initial date. The era of Kanishka was used continuously down to its year 281 (Fergusson Hist. of Ind. Architecture, 740) and after that date we have numerous instances of the use of the &#346;akan&#7771;ipak&#225;la or &#346;akak&#225;la down to the familiar &#346;aka of the present day. It seems much more likely that the parent of the modern &#346;aka era was that of Kanishka, which remained in use for nearly three centuries, than that of Nahap&#225;na, who so far as we know left no son, and whose era (if he founded one) probably expired when the Kshahar&#225;ta power was destroyed by the <corr sic="Andhrabh&#7771;ityas">&#193;ndhrabh&#7771;ityas</corr> in the first half of the second century <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi> We must therefore assume <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;78 to be the epoch of Kanishka&#8217;s era. There remains the question whether Nahap&#225;na dates by Kanishka&#8217;s era, or uses his own regnal years. There is nothing improbable in the latter supposition, and we are not forced to suppose that Nahap&#225;na was a feudatory of the Kush&#225;n kings. It has been shown above that the use of the title Kshatrapa does not necessarily imply a relation of inferiority. On the other hand (<hi>pace</hi> Oldenburg in <abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> X. 213) the later Kshatrapas certainly seem to have used Kanishka&#8217;s era: and Nahap&#225;na and the Kush&#225;n dynasty seem to have been of the same race: for Heraus, who was certainly a Kush&#225;n, apparently calls himself &#346;aka on his coins (Gardner B. M. Cat. xlvii.)<corr sic=":">;</corr> and it is highly probable that Nahap&#225;na, like his son-in-law Ushavad&#225;ta, was a &#346;aka. Further, the fact that Nahap&#225;na does not call himself Mah&#225;r&#225;ja but R&#225;ja goes to show that he was not a paramount sovereign.&#8212;(A. M. T. J.)</note>

By Nahap&#225;na&#8217;s time the M&#225;lavas seem to have moved eastwards towards Jaipur, as Ushavad&#225;ta defeated them in the neighbourhood of the Pushkar lake: but the fact that the country round Ujain was still known to Rudrad&#225;man as Avanti, shows that the M&#225;lavas had not yet (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;150) entered the district now known as M&#225;lava.

Further a chronological examination of the early ruling dynasties of Gujar&#225;t does not favour the identification of the Kshatrapa era with the M&#225;lava era. The available information regarding the three dynasties the Kshatrapas the Guptas and the Valabhis, is universally admitted to prove that they followed one another in chronological succession. The latest known Kshatrapa date is 310. Even after this we find the name of a later Kshatrapa king whose date is unknown but may be estimated at about 320. If we take this Kshatrapa 320 to be in the Vikrama Samvat, its equivalent is <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;264. In consequence of several new discoveries the epoch of the Gupta era has been finally settled to be <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;319. It is further settled that the first Gupta conqueror of M&#225;lwa and Gujar&#225;t was Chandragupta II.<note id="n29.2" n="2">Details are given below under the Guptas.</note> the date of his conquest of M&#225;lwa being Gupta 80 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;399). Counting the Kshatrapa dates in the Samvat era this gives a blank of (399 - 264 = ) 135 years between the latest Kshatrapa date and the date of Chandragupta&#8217;s conquest of Gujar&#225;t to fill which we have absolutely no historical information. On the other hand in support of the view that the Kshatrapa era is the &#346;aka era the K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a coins of the Gupta king Kum&#225;ragupta son of Chandragupta dated 100 Gupta closely resemble the coins of the latest Kshatrapa kings, the workmanship proving that the two styles of coin are close in point of time. Thus taking the Kshatrapa era to be the &#346;aka era the latest Kshatrapa date is 320 + 78 = <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;398, which is just the date (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;399) of Chandragupta&#8217;s conquest of M&#225;lwa and Gujar&#225;t. For these reasons, and in the absence of reasons to the contrary, it seems proper to take the dates in Ushavad&#225;ta&#8217;s and Ay&#225;ma&#8217;s inscriptions as in the era which began with Nahap&#225;na&#8217;s conquest of Gujar&#225;t, namely the &#346;aka era whose initial date is <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;78.

In Chash&#7789;ana&#8217;s coins we find this symbol between the sun and the moon, a position which suggests that the symbol represents the mythical mountain Meru, the three semicircular superimposed arches representing the peaks of the mountain and the crescent a <hi>Siddha-&#347;il&#226;</hi> or Siddhas&#8217; seat, which Jaina works describe as crescent-shaped and situated over Meru.

The fact that in his earlier coins Chash&#7789;ana is simply called a Kshatrapa and in his latter coins a Mah&#225;kshatrapa leads to the inference that his power was originally small.

Perhaps Chash&#7789;ana may have been the chief of the Uttamabhadra Kshatriyas, whom, in the year 42, Ushavad&#225;ta went to assist when they were besieged by the M&#225;layas or M&#225;lavas<note id="n32.4" n="4">See above page <ref type="pageref" target="pb29">29</ref>.</note>; and it is possible that the M&#225;lavas being thus driven away Chash&#7789;ana may have consolidated his power, taken possession of M&#225;lwa, and established his capital at Ujjain.

Chash&#7789;ana appears to have eventually taken K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a and as much of South Gujar&#225;t as belonged to Nahap&#225;na probably as far south as the Narbada. Mev&#225;&#7693;, M&#225;lwa, North and South Gujar&#225;t and K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a would then be subject to him and justify the title Mah&#225;kshatrapa on his later coins.

 </p><p><note place="margin">The Mevas or Me&#7693;as.</note>The bulk of Chash&#7789;ana&#8217;s army seems to have consisted of the Mevas or Me&#7693;as from whose early conquests and settlements in Central <corr sic="Rajput&#225;na">R&#225;jput&#225;na</corr> the province seems to have received its present name Mev&#225;&#7693;a. If this supposition be correct an inference may be drawn regarding the origin of Chash&#7789;ana. The Mathur&#225; inscription of Nandasirik&#225;, daughter of Kshatrapa R&#225;javula and mother of <corr sic="Kh&#225;raosti">Kharaosti</corr> Yuvar&#225;ja, mentions with respect a Mah&#225;kshatrapa Kuzulko Patika who is called in the inscription Mevaki that is of the Meva tribe. The inscription shows a relation between the Kharaostis (to which tribe we have taken Kshahar&#225;ta Nahap&#225;na to belong) and Mevaki Patika perhaps in the nature of subordinate and overlord. It proves at least that the Kharaostis held Patika in great honour and respect.

 </p><p>The Taxila plate shows that Patika was governor of Taxila during his father&#8217;s lifetime. After his father&#8217;s death when he became Mah&#225;kshatrapa, Patika&#8217;s capital was Nagaraka in the Jall&#225;l&#225;b&#225;d or K&#225;bul valley. The conquest of those parts by the great Kush&#225;n or Indo-Skythian king Kanishka (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;78) seems to have driven Patika&#8217;s immediate successors southwards to Sindh where they may have established a kingdom. The Skythian kingdom mentioned by the author of the Periplus as stretching in his time as far south as the mouths of the Indus may be a relic of this kingdom. Some time after their establishment in Sindh Patika&#8217;s successors may have sent Chash&#7789;ana, either a younger member of the reigning house or a military officer, with an army of Mevas through Umarkot and the Great Ran to Central <corr sic="Rajput&#225;na">R&#225;jput&#225;na</corr>, an expedition which ended in the settlement of the Mevas and the change of the country&#8217;s name to Mev&#225;&#7693;a. Probably it was on account of their previous ancestral connection that Nahap&#225;na sent Ushavad&#225;ta to help Chash&#7789;ana in Mev&#225;&#7693;a when besieged by his M&#225;lava neighbours. That Ushavad&#225;ta went to bathe and make gifts<note id="n33.1" n="1">See above page <ref type="pageref" target="pb25">25</ref>.</note> at Pushkara proves that the scene of the Uttamabhadras&#8217; siege by the M&#225;layas was in Mev&#225;&#7693;a not far from Pushkara.

 </p><p>Chash&#7789;ana is followed by an unbroken chain of successors all of the dynasty of which Chash&#7789;ana was the founder. As the coins of Chash&#7789;ana&#8217;s successors bear dates and as each coin gives the name of the king and of his father they supply a complete chronological list of the Kshatrapa dynasty.

 </p><p>Though the name is not given in any of these coins, the fact that Chash&#7789;ana was Jayad&#225;man&#8217;s father has been determined from the genealogy in the Gunda inscription of Rudrasim&#803;ha I. the seventh Kshatrapa,<note id="n34.2" n="2"><abbr>Ind.

All these inscriptions and the coins of his son Rudrad&#225;man call Jayad&#225;man Kshatrapa not Mah&#225;kshatrapa. This would seem to show either that he was a Kshatrapa or governor of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a under his father or that his father&#8217;s territory and his rank as Mah&#225;kshatrapa suffered some reduction.<note id="n34.5" n="5">The explanation of the reduction of Jayad&#225;man&#8217;s rank is probably to be found in the N&#225;sik Inscription (No. 26) of Gautam&#237;putra <corr sic="&#346;&#225;&#7789;akar&#7751;i">&#346;&#225;takar&#7751;i</corr> who claims to have conquered Sur&#225;sh&#7789;ra, Kukura (in <corr sic="Rajput&#225;na">R&#225;jput&#225;na</corr>), An&#250;pa, Vidarbha (<corr sic="Berar">Ber&#225;r</corr>), <corr sic="Akara">&#193;kara</corr>, and Avanti (Ujain).

 </p><p>An inscription on the Girn&#225;r rock gives us more information regarding Rudrad&#225;man than is available for any of the other Kshatrapas. The inscription records the construction of a new dam on the Sudar&#347;ana lake close to the inscription rock in place of a dam built in the time of the Maurya king Chandragupta (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;300) and added to in the time of his grandson the great <corr sic="&#193;&#347;oka">A&#347;oka</corr> (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;240) which had suddenly burst in a storm.

Sovasaka it will be noted is mentioned in the K&#225;rle inscription as an inhabitant of Abul&#225;m&#225;, apparently the old trade mart of Obollah at the head of the Persian Gulf. This trade connection between the Persian Gulf and the Western Indian seaboard must have led to the settlement from very early times of the Pahlavas who gradually became converted to Buddhism, and, like the <corr sic="Parsis">P&#225;rsis</corr> their modern enterprising representatives, seem to have advanced in trade and political influence. Subsequently the Pahlavas attained such influence that about the fifth century a dynasty of Pallava kings reigned in the Dekhan, Hindu in religion and name, even tracing their origin to the great ancient sage Bh&#225;radv&#225;ja.<note id="n35.4" n="4"><abbr>Ind.

 </p><p>That the Girn&#225;r inscription describes Rudrad&#225;man as the exterminator of &#8216;the Yaudheyas&#8217; and not of any king of the Yaudheyas confirms the view that their constitution was tribal or democratic.<note id="n37.3" n="3">Mr. Fleet notices a later inscription of a <hi>Mah&#225;r&#225;ja Mah&#225;sen&#225;pati</hi> &#8220;who has been set over&#8221; the &#8216;Yaudheya ga&#7751;a or tribe&#8217; in the fort of By&#225;na in Bharatpur. <abbr>Ind.

 </p><p>The style of the Yaudheya coins being an adaptation of the Kanishka type and their being found from Mathur&#225; to Sah&#225;ranpur where Kanishka ruled is a proof that the Yaudheyas wrested from the successors of Kanishka the greater part of the North-West Provinces. This is not to be understood to be the Yaudheyas&#8217; first conquest in India. They are known to be a very old tribe who after a temporary suppression by Kanishka must have again risen to power with the decline of Kush&#225;n rule under Kanishka&#8217;s successors Huvishka (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;100&#8211;123) or Vasudeva (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;123&#8211;150&#160;?) the latter of whom was a contemporary of Rudrad&#225;man.<note id="n37.4" n="4">Huvishka&#8217;s latest inscription bears date 45 that is <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;123 (Cunningham&#8217;s Arch.

Their forcible extermination is not to be understood literally but in the Indian hyperbolic fashion.

The evidence of their coins also shows that if not contemporaries Chash&#7789;ana and Pulum&#225;yi were not separated by any long interval. We know from the N&#225;sik inscriptions and the <corr sic="Pur&#225;nas">Pur&#225;&#7751;as</corr> that Pulum&#225;yi was the successor of Gautam&#237;putra <corr sic="&#346;&#225;takarni">&#346;&#225;takar&#7751;i</corr> and as Gautam&#237;putra <corr sic="&#346;&#225;takarni">&#346;&#225;takar&#7751;i</corr> is mentioned as the exterminator of the Kshahar&#225;ta race (and the period of this extermination has already been shown to be almost immediately after Nahap&#225;na&#8217;s death), there is no objection to the view that Chash&#7789;ana, who was the next Kshatrapa after Nahap&#225;na, and Pulum&#225;yi, who was the successor of Gautam&#237;putra, were contemporaries. We have no positive evidence to determine who was the immediate successor of Pulum&#225;yi, but the only king whose inscriptions are found in any number after Pulum&#225;yi is Gautam&#237;putra Yaj&#241;a &#346;r&#237; <corr sic="&#346;&#225;takarni">&#346;&#225;takar&#7751;i</corr>. His Kanheri inscription recording gifts made in his reign and his coin found among the relics of the Sop&#225;ra st&#250;pa built also in his reign prove that he held the North Konkan. The Sop&#225;ra coin gives the name of the father of Yaj&#241;a&#347;r&#237;. Unfortunately the coin is much worn.

The facts that he was called V&#225;sish&#7789;h&#237;putra and that he reigned at least thirteen years make it probable that Chaturapana was the brother and successor of Pulum&#225;yi. Yaj&#241;a&#347;r&#237; would thus be the nephew and second in succession to Pulum&#225;yi and the contemporary of Rudrad&#225;man the grandson of Chash&#7789;ana, whom we have taken to be a contemporary of Pulum&#225;yi. A further proof of this is afforded by Yaj&#241;a&#347;r&#237;&#8217;s silver coin found in the Sop&#225;ra st&#250;pa. All other &#193;ndhra coins hitherto found are adapted from contemporary coins of Ujjain and the Central Provinces, the latter probably of the &#346;ungas.

He is said &#8216;to have gained great fame by studying to the end, by remembering understanding and applying the great sciences such as grammar, polity, music, and logic&#8217;. Another epithet describes him as having &#8216;obtained numerous garlands at the Svayamvaras of kings&#8217; daughters,&#8217; apparently meaning that he was chosen as husband by princesses at several <hi>svayamvaras</hi> or choice-marriages a practice which seems to have been still in vogue in Rudrad&#225;man&#8217;s time. As a test of the civilized character of his rule it may be noted that he is described as &#8216;he who took, and kept to the end of his life, the vow to stop killing men except in battle.&#8217; Another epithet tells us that the embankment was built and the lake reconstructed by &#8216;expending a great amount of money from his own treasury, without oppressing the people of the town and of the province by (exacting) taxes, forced labour, acts of affection (benevolences) and the like.&#8217;

 </p><p>As the Kshatrapa year 60 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;138) has been taken to be the date of close of Chash&#7789;ana&#8217;s reign, and as five years may be allowed for the short reign<note id="n39.1" n="1">See above page <ref type="pageref" target="pb34">34.</ref></note> of Jayad&#225;man, the beginning of the reign of Rudrad&#225;man may be supposed to have been about the year 65 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;143). This Girn&#225;r inscription gives 72 as the year in which Rudrad&#225;man was then reigning and it is fair to suppose that he reigned probably up to 80. The conclusion is that Rudrad&#225;man ruled from <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;143 to 158.<note id="n39.2" n="2">It seems doubtful whether the Pandit&#8217;s estimate of fifteen years might not with advantage be increased. As his father&#8217;s reign was so short Rudrad&#225;man probably succeeded when still young. The abundance of his coins points to a long reign and the scarcity of the coins both of his son D&#225;m&#225;za&#7693;a and of his grandson J&#237;vad&#225;man imply that neither of his successors reigned more than a few years. Jivad&#225;man&#8217;s earliest date is <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;178 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 100). If five years are allowed to Jivad&#225;man&#8217;s father the end of Rudrad&#225;man&#8217;s reign would be <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;173 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 95) that is a reign of thirty years, no excessive term for a king who began to rule at a comparatively early age.&#8212;(A.

 </p><p>Coin C though struck from a different die is closely like B both on the obverse and the reverse. Neither the Greek legend nor the date is clear, though enough remains of the lower parts of the numerals to suggest the date 118. Coin D is in obverse closely like C. The date 118 is clear. On the reverse the legend and the symbols have been twice struck. The same legend occurs twice, the second striking having obliterated the last letters of the legend which contained the name of the king whose coin it is:

 </p><p>In these four specimens D&#225;ma&#347;r&#237; or D&#225;m&#225;ja&#7693;a is styled Mah&#225;kshatrapa, while in his own coins he is simply called Kshatrapa. The explanation perhaps is that the known coins of D&#225;ma&#347;r&#237; or D&#225;maja&#7693;a belong to the early part of his reign when he was subordinate to his father, and that he afterwards gained the title of Mah&#225;kshatrapa. Some such explanation is necessary as the distinction between the titles Kshatrapa and Mah&#225;kshatrapa is always carefully preserved in the earlier Kshatrapa coins. Except towards the close of the dynasty no ruler called Kshatrapa on his own coins is ever styled Mah&#225;kshatrapa on the coins of his son unless the father gained the more important title during his lifetime.

 </p><p>The dates and the difference in the style of die used in coining A and in coining B, C, and D are worth noting as the earliest coin has the date 100 and C and D the third and fourth coins have 118. If Jivad&#225;man&#8217;s reign lasted eighteen years his coins would be common instead of very rare. But we find between 102 and 118 numerous coins of Rudrasim&#803;ha son of Rudrad&#225;man and paternal uncle of Jivad&#225;man. These facts and the difference between the style of A and the style of B, C, and D which are apparently imitated from the coins of Rudrasim&#803;ha and have a face much older than the face in A, tend to show that soon after his accession Jivad&#225;man was deposed by his uncle Rudrasim&#803;ha, on whose death or defeat in 118, Jivad&#225;man again rose to power.

As the earliest year is 103 and the latest 118 it is probable that Rudrasim&#803;ha deposed his nephew Jivad&#225;man shortly after Jivad&#225;man&#8217;s accession. Rudrasim&#803;ha appears to have ruled fifteen years when power again passed to his nephew Jivad&#225;man.

The date is given both in words and in numerals as 103, &#8216;in the year&#8217; of the king the Kshatrapa Sv&#225;mi Rudrasim&#803;ha, apparently meaning in the year 103 during the reign of Rudrasim&#803;ha. The genealogy given in the inscription is: 1 Chash&#7789;ana; 2 Jayad&#225;man; 3 Rudrad&#225;man; 4 Rudrasim&#803;ha, the order of succession being clearly defined by the text, which says that the fourth was the great grandson of the first, the grandson of the second, and the son of the third. It will be noted that D&#225;m&#225;ja&#7693;a&#347;r&#237; and <corr sic="J&#237;vad&#225;m&#225;n">Jivad&#225;man</corr> the fifth and sixth Kshatrapas have been passed over in this genealogy probably because the inscription did not intend to give a complete genealogy but only to show the descent of Rudrasim&#803;ha in the direct line.

The following reasons seem conclusive against identifying San&#775;ghad&#225;man with Sandanes: (1) The abbreviation from San&#775;ghad&#225;man to Sandanes seems excessive in the case of the name of a well known ruler who lived within thirty years of the probable time (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;247) when the writer of the Periplus visited Gujar&#225;t and the Konkan: (2) The date of San&#775;ghad&#225;man (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;222&#8211;226) is twenty to thirty years too early for the probable collection of the Periplus details: (3) Apart from the date of the Periplus the apparent distinction in the writer&#8217;s mind between Sandanes&#8217; capture of Kaly&#225;n and his own time implies a longer lapse than suits a reign of only four years.

 </p><p>In favour of the Sandanes of the Periplus being a dynastic not a personal name is its close correspondence both in form and in geographical position with Ptolemy&#8217;s (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;150) Sadaneis, who gave their name, Ariake Sadin&#244;n or the Sadins&#8217; Aria, to the North Konkan, and, according to McCrindle (Ptolemy, 39) in the time of Ptolemy ruled the prosperous trading communities that occupied the sea coast to about Semulla or Chaul. The details in the present text show that some few years before Ptolemy wrote the conquests of Rudrad&#225;man had brought the North Konkan under the Gujar&#225;t <corr sic="Kshatrap&#225;s">Kshatrapas</corr>. Similarly shortly before the probable date of the Periplus (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;247) the fact that San&#775;ghad&#225;man and his successors D&#225;masena (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;226&#8211;236) and Vijayasena (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;238&#8211;249) all used the title Mah&#225;kshatrapa makes their possession of the North Konkan probable. The available details of the K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a Kshatrapas therefore confirm the view that the Sadans of Ptolemy and the Sandanes of the Periplus are the Gujar&#225;t Kshatrapas. The question remains how did the Greeks come to know the Kshatrapas by the name of Sadan or Sandan. The answer seems to be the word Sadan or Sandan is the Sanskrit <hi>S&#225;dhana</hi> which according to Lassen (McCrindle&#8217;s Ptolemy, 40) and Williams&#8217; Sanskrit Dictionary may mean agent or representative and may therefore be an accurate rendering of Kshatrapa in the sense of Viceroy. Wilford (<abbr expan="Asiatic Researches">As. Res.</abbr> IX. 76, 198) notices that Sanskrit writers give the early English in India the title S&#225;dhan Engrez. This Wilford would translate Lord but it seems rather meant for a rendering of the word Factor. Prof. <corr sic="Bh&#225;nd&#225;rkar">Bhand&#225;rkar</corr> (<abbr>Bom. Gaz.</abbr> XIII. 418 note 1) notices a tribe mentioned by the geographer Var&#225;hamihira (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;580) as &#346;&#225;ntikas and associated with the Apar&#225;ntakas or people of the west coast. He shows how according to the rules of letter changes the Sanskrit &#346;&#225;ntika would in Pr&#225;krit be S&#225;ndino. In his opinion it was this form Sandino which was familiar to Greek merchants and sailors. Prof. Bhand&#225;rkar holds that when (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;100&#8211;110) the Kshatrapa Nahap&#225;na displaced the &#346;&#225;tav&#225;hanas or &#193;ndhrabh&#7771;ityas the &#346;&#225;ntikas or Sandino became independent in the North Konkan and took Kaly&#225;n. To make their independence secure against the Kshatrapas they forbad intercourse between their own territory and the Dakhan and sent foreign ships to Barygaza. Against this explanation it is to be urged; (1) That N&#225;sik and Junnar inscriptions show Nahap&#225;na supreme in the North Konkan at least up to <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;120; (2) That according to the Periplus the action taken by the Sandans or Sadans was not against the Kshatrapas but against the <corr sic="&#346;&#225;takarnis">&#346;&#225;takar&#7751;is</corr>; (3) That the action was not taken in the time of Nahap&#225;na but at a later time, later not only than the first Gautam&#237;putra the conqueror of Nahap&#225;na or his son-in-law Ushavad&#225;ta (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;138), but later than the second Gautam&#237;putra, who was defeated by the K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a Kshatrapa Rudrad&#225;man some time before <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;150; (4) That if the &#346;&#225;ntikas were solely a North <pb/>Konkan tribe they would neither wish nor be able to send foreign ships to Broach. The action described in the Periplus of refusing to let Greek ships enter Kaly&#225;n and of sending all such ships to Broach was the action of a Gujar&#225;t conqueror of Kaly&#225;n determined to make foreign trade centre in his own chief emporium Broach. The only possible lord of Gujar&#225;t either in the second or third century who can have adopted such a policy was the Kshatrapa of Ujjain in M&#225;lwa and of Minnagara or <corr sic="Junaga&#7693;h">Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h</corr> in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a, the same ruler, who, to encourage foreign vessels to visit Broach had (McCrindle&#8217;s Periplus, 118, 119) stationed native fishermen with well-manned long boats off the south K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a coast to meet ships and pilot them through the tidal and other dangers up the Narbada to Broach. It follows that the Sandanes of the Periplus and Ptolemy&#8217;s North Konkan S&#225;dans are the Gujar&#225;t Mah&#225;kshatrapas. The correctness of this identification of Sadan with the Sanskrit S&#225;dhan and the explanation of S&#225;dhan as a translation of Kshatrapa or representative receive confirmation from the fact that the account of K&#225;lak&#225;ch&#225;rya in the Bharahe&#347;wara V&#7771;&#237;tti (<abbr expan="Journal Bombay Branch Royal Asiatic Society">J. B. B. R. A. S.</abbr> IX. 141&#8211;142), late in date (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1000&#8211;1100) but with notable details of the &#346;aka or &#346;&#225;hi invaders, calls the &#346;aka king S&#225;dhana-Sim&#803;ha. If on this evidence it may be held that the Kshatrapas were known as S&#225;dhanas, it seems to follow that &#346;&#225;ntika the form used by Var&#225;hamihira (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;505&#8211;587) is a conscious and intentional Sanskritizing of S&#225;dan whose correct form and origin had passed out of knowledge, a result which would suggest conscious or artificial Sanskritizing as the explanation of the forms of many <corr sic="Pur&#225;nic">Pur&#225;&#7751;ic</corr> tribal and place names. A further important result of this inquiry is to show that the received date of <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;70 for the Periplus cannot stand. Now that the Kanishka era <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;78 is admitted to be the era used by the Kshatrapas both in the Dakhan and in Gujar&#225;t it follows that a writer who knows the elder and the younger <corr sic="&#346;&#225;takarnis">&#346;&#225;takar&#7751;is</corr> cannot be earlier than <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;150 and from the manner in which he refers to them must almost certainly be considerably later. This conclusion supports the date <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;247 which on other weighty grounds the French scholar Reinaud (<abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> Dec. 1879. pp. 330, 338) has assigned to the Periplus.</p></note>

This date would give Rudrasena a reign of about sixteen years, a length of rule supported by the large number of his coins. The legend reads:

The presumption that Kshatrapa power was at its height during the reigns of the kings whose coins have been found at Kar&#225;d is strengthened by the discovery at Amr&#225;vati in the <corr sic="Berars">Ber&#225;rs</corr> of a hoard of coins of the Mah&#225;kshatrapa Rudrasena (II.&#160;?)

That Rudrasim&#803;ha is called a Kshatrapa may show that part of the Kshatrapa dominion which had been lost during the reign of Vi&#347;vasena was given to some distant member or scion of the Kshatrapa dynasty of the name of Rudrasim&#803;ha. The occurrence of political changes is further shown by the fact that the coins of Rudrasim&#803;ha are of a better type than those of the preceding Kshatrapas. Rudrasim&#803;ha&#8217;s coins are fairly common. Of twelve in Dr. Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l&#8217;s collection five are clearly dated, three 230, one 231, and one 240.

 </p><p>It will be noted that in this coin both Rudrasim&#803;ha and D&#225;masiri are called great Kshatrapas, while in his own coin and in the coins of his son Ya&#347;ad&#225;man, Rudrasim&#803;ha is simply styled Kshatrapa. It is possible that D&#225;masiri may have been more powerful than Ya&#347;ad&#225;man and consequently taken to himself the title of Mah&#225;kshatrapa. The application of the more important title to a father who in life had not enjoyed the title is not an uncommon practice among the later Kshatrapas. The rarity of D&#225;masiri&#8217;s coins shows that his reign was short.

 </p><p>After D&#225;masiri comes a blank of about thirty years. The next coin is dated 270. The fact that, contrary to what might have been expected, the coins of the later Kshatrapas are less common than those of the earlier Kshatrapas, seems to point to some great political change during the twenty-seven years ending 270 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;321&#8211;348).

 </p><p><note place="margin">Kshatrapa XXIV. Rudrasena, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;348&#8211;376.</note>The coin dated 270 belongs to Sv&#225;mi Rudrasena son of Sv&#225;mi Rudrad&#225;man both of whom the legend styles Mah&#225;kshatrapas. The type of the coin dated 270 is clearly adapted from the type of the coins of Ya&#347;ad&#225;man. Only two of Rudrasena&#8217;s coins dated 270 are recorded. But later coins of the same Kshatrapa of a different style are found in large numbers. Of fifty-four in the Pandit&#8217;s collection, twelve have the following dates 288, 290, 292, 293, 294, 296, and 298. The difference in the style of the two sets of coins and the blank between 270 and 288 leave no doubt that during those years some political change took place. Probably Rudrasena was for a time overthrown but again came to power in 288 and maintained his position till 298. Besides calling both himself and his father Mah&#225;kshatrapas Rudrasena adds to both the attribute Sv&#225;mi. As no coin of Rudrasena&#8217;s father is recorded it seems probable the father was not an independent ruler and that the legend on Rudrasena&#8217;s coins is a further instance of a son ennobling his father. The legend is the same both in the earlier coins of 270 and in the later coins ranging from 288 to 298. It reads:

 </p><p>Of Rudrasena&#8217;s father Satyasena no coin is recorded and as this Rudrasena immediately succeeds Rudrasena IV. son of Rudrad&#225;man, there is little doubt that Satyasena was not an actual ruler with the great title Mah&#225;kshatrapa, but that this was an honorific title given to the father when his son attained to sovereignty. General Cunningham records that a coin of this Rudrasena IV. was found along with a coin of Chandragupta II. in a <hi>st&#250;pa</hi> at Sult&#225;nganj on the Ganges about fifteen miles south-east of Mongir.<note id="n51.2" n="2">This coin of Rudrasena may have been taken so far from Gujar&#225;t by the Gujar&#225;t monk in whose honour the <hi>st&#250;pa</hi> was built.</note>

Only one coin in Dr. Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l&#8217;s collection is clearly later than Rudrasena IV. In the form of the bust and the style of the legend on the reverse this specimen closely resembles the coins of Rudrasena IV. Unfortunately owing to imperfect stamping it bears no date.

 </p><p>This legend would seem to show that Rudrasena IV. left no issue and was succeeded by his nephew Sim&#803;hasena. The extreme rarity of Sim&#803;hasena&#8217;s coins proves that his reign was very short.

At the same time the text of the N&#225;gar&#237; legend differs from that on the reverse of the Kshatrapa coins by omitting the name of the ruler&#8217;s father and by showing in words &#205;&#347;varadatta&#8217;s date in the year of his own reign. The legend is:

 </p><p>Most of the recorded coins of &#205;&#347;varadatta have this legend. In one specimen the legend is

 </p><p>It is clear from this that &#205;&#347;varadatta&#8217;s reign did not last long. His peculiar name and his separate date leave little doubt that he belonged to some distinct family of Kshatrapas. The general style of his coins shows that he cannot have been a late Kshatrapa while the fact that he is called Mah&#225;kshatrapa seems to show he was an independent ruler. No good evidence is available for fixing his date. As already mentioned the workmanship of his coins brings him near to Vijayasena (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;238&#8211;249). In N&#225;sik Cave X. the letters of Inscription XV. closely correspond with the letters of the legends on Kshatrapa coins, and probably belong to almost the same date as the inscription of <corr sic="Rudr&#225;daman">Rudrad&#225;man</corr> on the Girn&#225;r rock that is to about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;150. The absence of any record of the &#193;ndhras except the name of the king Madhar&#237;puta Sirisena or Sakasena (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;180), makes it probable that after Yaj&#241;a&#347;r&#237; Gautam&#237;putra (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;150) &#193;ndhra power waned along the Konkan and South Gujar&#225;t seaboard. According to the <corr sic="Pur&#225;nas">Pur&#225;&#7751;as</corr> the &#193;bh&#237;ras succeeded to the dominion of the &#193;ndhras. It is therefore possible that the &#193;bh&#237;ra king &#205;&#347;varasena of N&#225;sik Inscription XV. was one of the &#193;bh&#237;ra conquerors of the &#193;ndhras who took from them the West Dakhan. A migration of &#193;bh&#237;ras from Ptolemy&#8217;s Abiria in Upper Sindh through Sindh by sea to the Konkan and thence to N&#225;sik is within the range of possibility. About fifty years later king &#205;&#347;varadatta<note id="n52.1" n="1">&#205;&#347;varadatta&#8217;s name ends in <hi>datta</hi> as does also that of &#346;ivadatta the father of king &#205;&#347;varasena of the N&#225;sik inscription.</note> who was perhaps of the same family as the &#193;bh&#237;ra king of the N&#225;sik inscription seems to have conquered the kingdom of Kshatrapa Vijayasena, adding Gujar&#225;t, K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a, and part of the Dakhan to his other territory. In honour of this great conquest he may have taken the title Mah&#225;kshatrapa and struck coins in the Gujar&#225;t Kshatrapa style but in an era reckoned from the date of his own conquest. &#205;&#347;varadatta&#8217;s success was shortlived. Only two years later (that is about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;252) the Mah&#225;kshatrapa <corr sic="D&#225;m&#225;ja&#7693;asr&#237;">D&#225;m&#225;ja&#7693;a&#347;r&#237;</corr> won back the lost Kshatrapa territory. The fact that &#205;&#347;varadatta&#8217;s recorded coins belong to only two years and that the break between the regular <pb id="pb53" n="53"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter V.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Western Kshatrapas, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;70&#8211;398.</hi></item></list> </fw>Kshatrapas Vijayasena and D&#225;m&#225;ja&#7693;a&#347;r&#237; did not last more than two or three years gives support to this explanation.<note id="n53.1" n="1">Dr. Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l&#8217;s suggestion that Vijayasena (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;238&#8211;249) was defeated by the &#193;bh&#237;r or Ah&#237;r king &#205;&#347;varadatta who entered Gujar&#225;t from the North Konkan seems open to question. First as regards the suggestion that Vijayasena was the Kshatrapa whose power &#205;&#347;varadatta overthrew it is to be noticed that though the two coinless years (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;249&#8211;251) between the last coin of Vijayasena and the earliest coin of D&#225;m&#225;ja&#7693;a&#347;r&#237; agree with the recorded length of &#205;&#347;varadatta&#8217;s supremacy the absence of coins is not in itself proof of a reverse or loss of Kshatrapa power between the reigns of Vijayasena and <corr sic="D&#225;m&#225;jada&#347;r&#237;">D&#225;m&#225;ja&#7693;a&#347;r&#237;</corr>. It is true the Pandit considers that &#205;&#347;varadatta&#8217;s coins closely resemble those of Vijayasena. At the same time he also (N&#225;sik Stat. Acct. 624) thought them very similar to V&#237;rad&#225;man&#8217;s (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;236&#8211;238) coins. V&#237;rad&#225;man&#8217;s date so immediately precedes Vijayasena&#8217;s that in many respects their coins must be closely alike. It is to be noted that <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;230&#8211;235 the time of rival Kshatrapas among whom V&#237;rad&#225;man was one (especially the time between <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;236 and 238 during which none of the rivals assumed the title Mah&#225;kshatrapa) was suitable to (perhaps was the result of) a successful invasion by &#205;&#347;varadatta, and that this same invasion may have been the cause of the transfer of the capital, noted in the Periplus (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;247) as having taken place some years before, from Ozene or Ujjain to Minnagara or <corr sic="Jun&#225;gadh">Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h</corr> (McCrindle, 114, 122). On the other hand the fact that Vijayasena regained the title of Mah&#225;kshatrapa and handed it to his successor D&#225;m&#225;ja&#7693;a&#347;r&#237; III. would seem to shew that no reverse or humiliation occurred during the coinless years (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;249&#8211;251) between their reigns, a supposition which is supported by the flourishing state of the kingdom at the time of the Periplus (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;247) and also by the evidence that both the above Kshatrapas ruled near Kar&#225;d in S&#225;t&#225;ra. At the same time if the difference <corr sic="betweed">between</corr> V&#237;rad&#225;man&#8217;s and Vijayasena&#8217;s coins is sufficient to make it unlikely that &#205;&#347;varadatta&#8217;s can be copies of V&#237;rad&#225;man&#8217;s it seems possible that the year of &#205;&#347;varadatta&#8217;s overlordship may be the year <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;244 (K. 166) in which Vijayasena&#8217;s coins bear the title Kshatrapa, and that the assumption of this lower title in the middle of a reign, which with this exception throughout claims the title Mah&#225;kshatrapa, may be due to the temporary necessity of acknowledging the supremacy of &#205;&#347;varadatta. With reference to the Pandit&#8217;s suggestion that &#205;&#347;varadatta was an &#193;bh&#237;ra the fact noted above of a trace of Kshatrapa rule at Kar&#225;d thirty-one miles south of S&#225;t&#225;ra together with the fact that they held Apar&#225;nta or the Konkan makes it probable that they reached Kar&#225;d by Chipl&#250;n and the Kumbh&#225;rli pass. That the Kshatrapas entered the Dakhan by so southerly a route instead of by some one of the more central Th&#225;na passes, seems to imply the presence of some hostile power in N&#225;sik and Kh&#225;ndesh. This after the close of the second century <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi> could hardly have been the &#193;ndhras or <corr sic="&#346;&#225;t&#225;karnis">&#346;&#225;takar&#7751;is</corr>. It may therefore be presumed to have been the &#193;ndhras&#8217; successors the &#193;bh&#237;ras. As regards the third suggestion that Kshatrapa Gujar&#225;t was overrun from the North Konkan it is to be noted that the evidence of connection between &#205;&#347;varasena of the N&#225;sik inscription (Cave X. No. 15) and &#205;&#347;varadatta of the coins is limited to a probable nearness in time and a somewhat slight similarity in name. On the other hand no inscription or other record points to &#193;bh&#237;ra ascendancy in the North Konkan or South Gujar&#225;t. The presence of an &#193;bh&#237;ra power in the North Konkan seems inconsistent with Kshatrapa rule at Kaly&#225;n and Kar&#225;d in the second half of the third century. The position allotted to Aberia in the Periplus (McCrindle, 113) inland from Surastrene, apparently in the neighbourhood of Thar and P&#225;rkar; the finding of &#205;&#347;varadatta&#8217;s coins in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a (N&#225;sik Gazetteer, XIII. 624); and (perhaps between <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;230 and 240) the transfer westwards of the head-quarters of the Kshatrapa kingdom seem all to point to the east rather than to the south, as the side from which &#205;&#347;varadatta invaded Gujar&#225;t. At the same time the reference during the reign of Rudrasim&#803;ha I. (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;181) to the &#193;bh&#237;ra Rudrabh&#250;ti who like his father was Sen&#225;pati or Commander-in-Chief suggests that &#205;&#347;varadatta may have been not a foreigner but a revolted general. This supposition, his assumption of the title Mah&#225;kshatrapa, and the finding of his coins only in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a to a certain extent confirm.</note>

All the recorded information is in two copperplates, one the Kanheri copperplate found by Dr. Bird in 1839,<note id="n55.1" n="1">Cave Temple Inscriptions, <abbr>Bom. Arch. Sur. Sep.</abbr> Number XI. page 57ff.</note> the other a copperplate found at P&#225;rdi near Bals&#225;r in 1885.<note id="n55.2" n="2"><abbr>J. B. B. R. A. S.</abbr> XVI. 346.</note> Both plates are dated, the Kanheri plate &#8216;in the year two hundred and forty-five of the increasing rule of the Traik&#250;&#7789;akas&#8217;; the P&#225;rdi plate in Sam&#803;vat 207 clearly figured. The Kanheri plate contains nothing of historical importance; the P&#225;rdi plate gives the name of the donor as Dahrasena or Dharasena &#8216;the illustrious great king of the Traik&#250;&#7789;akas.&#8217; Though it does not give any royal name the Kanheri plate expressly mentions the date as the year 245 of the increasing rule of the Traik&#250;&#7789;akas. The P&#225;rdi plate gives the name of the king as &#8216;of the Traik&#250;&#7789;akas&#8217; but merely mentions the date as Sam&#803;. 207. This date though not stated to be in the era of the Traik&#250;&#7789;akas must be taken to be dated in the same era as the Kanheri plate seeing that the style of the letters of both plates is very similar.

 </p><p>The initial date must therefore have been started by the founder of the dynasty and the Kanheri plate proves the dynasty must have lasted at least 245 years. The P&#225;rdi plate is one of the earliest copper-plate grants in India. Neither the genealogy nor even the usual three generations including the father and grandfather are given, nor like later plates does it contain a wealth of attributes. The king is called &#8216;the great king of the Traik&#250;&#7789;akas,&#8217; the performer of the <hi>a&#347;vamedha</hi> or horse-sacrifice, a distinction bespeaking a powerful sovereign. It may therefore be supposed that Dahrasena held South Gujar&#225;t to the <corr sic="Narb&#225;da">Narbad&#225;</corr> together with part of the North Konkan and of the Gh&#225;t and Dakhan plateau.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Initial Date.</note>What then was the initial date of the Traik&#250;&#7789;akas? Ten Gujar&#225;t copper-plates of the Gurjjaras and Chalukyas are dated in an unknown era with Sam&#803;. followed by the date figures as in the P&#225;rdi plate and as in Gupta inscriptions. The earliest is the fragment from <corr sic="S&#225;n&#775;khe&#7693;&#225;">San&#775;khe&#7693;&#225;</corr> in the Baroda State dated Sam&#803;<corr>.</corr> 346, which would fall in the reign of Dadda I. of Broach.<note id="n55.3" n="3">Epigraphia Indica, II. 19.</note> Next come the two Kaira grants of the Gurjjara king Dadda Pra&#347;&#225;ntar&#225;ga dated Sam&#803;. 380 and Sam&#803;. 385<note id="n55.4" n="4"><abbr>Ind.

 </p><p>Of these the grant dated 421 speaks of &#346;&#237;l&#225;ditya <corr sic="&#346;ry&#225;sraya">&#346;ry&#225;&#347;raya</corr> as Yuvar&#225;ja or heir-apparent and as the son of Jayasim&#803;havarmman. The plate further shows that Jayasim&#803;havarmman was brother of Vikram&#225;ditya and son of Pulake&#347;i Vallabha &#8216;the conqueror of the northern king Harshavardhana.&#8217; The name Jayasim&#803;havarmman does not occur in any copperplate of the main line of the Western Chalukyas of the Dakhan. That he is called Mah&#225;r&#225;ja or great king and that his son &#346;&#237;l&#225;ditya is called Yuvar&#225;ja or heir-apparent suggest that Jayasim&#803;havarmman was the founder of the Gujar&#225;t branch of the Western Chalukyas and that his great Dakhan brother Vikram&#225;ditya was his overlord, a relation which would explain the mention of Vikram&#225;ditya in the genealogy of the copper-plate. Vikram&#225;ditya&#8217;s reign ended in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;680 (&#346;aka 602).<note id="n56.5" n="5">Fleet&#8217;s K&#225;narese Dynasties, 27.</note> Supposing our grant to be dated in this last year of Vikram&#225;ditya, Sam&#803;vat 421 should correspond to &#346;aka 602, which gives &#346;aka 181 or <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;259 as the initial date of the era in which the plate is dated. Probably the plate was dated earlier in the reign of Vikram&#225;ditya giving <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;250. In any case the era used cannot be the Gupta era whose initial year is now finally settled to be <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;319.

 </p><p>The second grant of the same &#346;&#237;l&#225;ditya is dated Sam&#803;vat 443. In it, both in an eulogistic verse at the beginning and in the text of the genealogy, Vinay&#225;ditya Saty&#225;&#347;raya Vallabha is mentioned as the paramount sovereign which proves that by Sam&#803;vat 443 Vikram&#225;ditya had been succeeded by Vinay&#225;ditya. The reign of Vinay&#225;ditya has been fixed as lasting from &#346;aka 602 to &#346;aka 618 that is from <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;680 to <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;696&#8211;97.<note id="n56.6" n="6">Fleet&#8217;s K&#225;narese Dynasties, 27.</note> Taking &#346;aka 615 or <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;693 to correspond with Sam&#803;vat 443, the initial year of the era is <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;250.

 </p><p>The grant of Pulake&#347;ivallabha <corr sic="Jan&#225;sraya">Jan&#225;&#347;raya</corr> dated Sam&#803;vat 490, mentions Mangalarasar&#225;ya as the donor&#8217;s elder brother and as the son of Jayasim&#803;havarmman. And a Bals&#225;r grant whose donor is mentioned as Mangalar&#225;ja son of Jayasim&#803;havarmman, apparently the same as the Mangalarasar&#225;ya of the plate just mentioned, is dated &#346;aka 653.<note id="n56.7" n="7"><abbr>Ind.

Ant.</abbr> XVII. 215.</note> The next question is, Who were these Traik&#250;&#7789;akas. The meaning of the title seems to be kings of Trik&#250;&#7789;a. Several references seem to point to the existence of a city named Trik&#250;&#7789;a on the western seaboard. In describing Raghu&#8217;s triumphant progress the R&#225;m&#225;ya&#7751;a and the Raghuvam&#803;&#347;a mention him as having established the city of Trik&#250;&#7789;a in Apar&#225;nta on the western seaboard.<note id="n57.2" n="2">V&#225;lm&#237;ki&#8217;s R&#225;m&#225;ya&#7751;a, Ganpat Krishnaji&#8217;s Edition: Raghuvam&#803;&#347;a, IV. 59.</note> Trik&#250;&#7789;akam or Trik&#250;&#7789;am, a Sanskrit name for sea salt seems a reminiscence of the time when Trik&#250;&#7789;a was the emporium from which Konkan salt was distributed over the Dakhan. The scanty information regarding the territory ruled by the Traik&#250;&#7789;akas is in agreement with the suggestion that Junnar in North Poona was the probable site of their capital and that in the three ranges that encircle Junnar we have the origin of the term Trik&#250;&#7789;a or Three-Peaked.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Their Race or Tribe.</note>Of the race or tribe of the Traik&#250;&#7789;akas nothing is known. The conjecture may be offered that they are a branch of the &#193;bh&#237;ra kings of the Pur&#225;&#7751;as, one of whom is mentioned in Inscription XV. of N&#225;sik Cave X. which from the style of the letters belongs to about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;150 to 200. The easy connection between N&#225;sik and Bals&#225;r by way of Peth (Peint) and the nearness in time between the N&#225;sik inscription and the initial date of the Traik&#250;&#7789;akas support this conjecture. The further suggestion may be offered that the founder of the line of Traik&#250;&#7789;akas was the &#205;&#347;varadatta, who, as noted in the Kshatrapa chapter, held the overlordship of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a as Mah&#225;kshatrapa, perhaps during the two years <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;248 and 249, a result in close agreement with the conclusions drawn from the examination of the above quoted Traik&#250;&#7789;aka and Chalukya copperplates. As noted in the Kshatrapa chapter after two years&#8217; supremacy &#205;&#347;varadatta seems to have been defeated and regular Kshatrapa rule restored about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;252 (K. 174) by D&#225;m&#225;ja&#7693;a&#347;r&#237; son of Vijayasena. The unbroken use of the title Mah&#225;kshatrapa, the moderate and uniform lengths of the reigns, and the apparently unquestioned successions suggest, what the discovery of Kshatrapa coins at Kar&#225;d near S&#225;t&#225;ra in the Dakhan and at Amr&#225;vati in the Ber&#225;rs seems to imply, that during the second half of the third century Kshatrapa rule was widespread and firmly established.<note id="n57.3" n="3">For details see above page <ref type="pageref" target="pb48">48</ref>.</note> The conjecture may be offered that Rudrasena (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;256&#8211;272) whose coins have been found in Amr&#225;vati in the Ber&#225;rs spread his power at the expense of the Traik&#250;&#7789;akas driving them towards the Central Provinces where they established themselves at Tripura and K&#225;lanjara.<note id="n57.4" n="4">Tripura four miles west of Jabalpur; K&#225;lanjara 140 miles north of Jabalpur.</note> Further that under Br&#225;hman <pb id="pb58" n="58"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter VI.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Traik&#250;&#7789;akas, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;250&#8211;450.</hi></item><item>Their Race or Tribe.</item></list> </fw>influence, just as the Gurjjaras called themselves descendants of Kar&#7751;a the hero of the Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata, and the Pallavas claimed to be of the Bh&#225;radv&#225;ja stock, the Traik&#250;&#7789;akas forgot their &#193;bh&#237;ra origin and claimed descent from the Haihayas. Again as the Valabhis (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;480&#8211;767) adopted the Gupta era but gave it their own name so the rulers of Tripura seem to have continued the original Traik&#250;&#7789;aka era of <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;248&#8211;9 under the name of the Chedi era. The decline of the Kshatrapas dates from about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;300 the rule of Vi&#347;vasena the twentieth Kshatrapa son of Bhartt&#7771;id&#225;man. The subsequent disruption of the Kshatrapa empire was probably the work of their old neighbours and foes the Traik&#250;&#7789;akas, who, under the name of Haihayas, about the middle of the fifth century (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;455&#8211;6) rose to supremacy and established a branch at their old city of Trik&#250;&#7789;a ruling the greater part of the Bombay Dakhan and South Gujar&#225;t and probably filling the blank between <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;410 the fall of the Kshatrapas and <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;500 the rise of the Ch&#225;lukyas.

 </p><p>At Kar&#225;d, thirty-one miles south of S&#225;t&#225;ra, Mr. Justice Newton obtained a coin of this Rudraga&#7751;a, with the coins of many Kshatrapas including Vi&#347;vasim&#803;ha son of Bhartt&#7771;id&#225;man who ruled up to <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;300. This would favour the view that Rudraga&#7751;a was the successful rival who wrested the Dakhan and North Konkan from Vi&#347;vasim&#803;ha. The fact that during the twenty years after Vi&#347;vasim&#803;ha (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;300&#8211;320) none of the Kshatrapas has the title Mah&#225;kshatrapa seems to show they ruled in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a as tributaries of this Rudraga&#7751;a and his descendants of the Traik&#250;&#7789;aka family. The Dahrasena of the P&#225;rdi plate whose inscription date is 207, that is <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;457, may be a descendant of Rudraga&#7751;a. The Traik&#250;&#7789;aka kingdom would thus seem to have flourished at least till the middle of the fifth century. Somewhat later, or at any rate after the date of the Kanheri plate (245 = <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;495), it was overthrown by either the Mauryas or the Guptas.<note id="n58.1" n="1"><p>That the era used by the Gurjjaras and Chalukyas of Gujar&#225;t was the Chedi era may be regarded as certain since the discovery of the <corr sic="&#346;&#225;n&#775;khed&#225;">San&#775;khe&#7693;&#225;</corr> grant of Nirihullaka (<abbr>Ep. Ind.</abbr> II. 21), who speaks of a certain &#346;an&#775;kara&#7751;a as his overlord. Pal&#230;ographically this grant belongs to the sixth century, and Dr. B&#252;hler has suggested that &#346;an&#775;kara&#7751;a is the Chedi &#346;an&#775;karaga&#7751;a whose son Buddhar&#225;ja was defeated by Mangal&#237;&#347;a some time before <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;602 (<abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> XIX. 16). If this is accepted, the grant shows that the Chedis or Kalachuris were in power in the <corr sic="Narb&#225;da">Narbad&#225;</corr> valley during the sixth century, which explains the prevalence of their era in South Gujar&#225;t. Chedi rule in the <corr sic="Narb&#225;d&#225;">Narbad&#225;</corr> valley must have come to an end about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;580 when Dadda I. established himself at Broach. It being established that the Kalachuris once ruled in South Gujar&#225;t, there is no great difficulty in the way of identifying the Traik&#250;&#7789;akas with them. The two known Traik&#250;&#7789;aka grants are dated in the third century of their era, and belong pal&#230;ographically to the fifth century <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi> Their era, therefore, like that of the Kalachuris, begins in the third century <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>: and it is simpler to suppose that the two eras were the same than <pb/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter VI.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Traik&#250;&#7789;akas, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;250&#8211;450.</hi></item></list> </fw>that two different eras, whose initial points were only a few years apart, were in use in the same district. Now that the &#346;aka and the Vikrama eras are known to have had different names at different times, the change in the name of the era offers no special difficulty. This identification would carry back Kalachuri rule in South Gujar&#225;t to at least <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;456&#8211;6, the date of the P&#225;rdi grant: and it is worth noting that Var&#225;hamihira (B&#7771;. Sam&#803;h. XIV. 20) places the Haihayas or Kalachuris in the west along with the Apar&#225;ntakas or Konkanis.

 </p><p>Though the name Traik&#250;&#7789;aka means of Trik&#250;&#7789;a, the authorities quoted by Dr. Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l do not establish the existence of a city called Trik&#250;&#7789;a. They only vouch for a mountain of that name somewhere in the Western Gh&#225;ts, and there is no evidence of any special connection with Junnar. Further, the word Trik&#250;&#7789;akam seems to mean rock-salt, not sea-salt, so that there is here no special connection with the Western coast. Wherever Trik&#250;&#7789;a may have been, there seems no need to reject the tradition that connects the rise of the Kalachuris with their capture of K&#225;lanjara (Cunningham&#8217;s <abbr expan="Arch&#230;ological Survey">Arch. Surv.</abbr> IX. 77ff), as it is more likely that they advanced from the East down the <corr sic="Narb&#225;d&#225;">Narbad&#225;</corr> than that their original seats were on the West Coast, as the Western Indian inscriptions of the third and fourth centuries contain no reference either to Traik&#250;&#7789;akas or to Junnar or other western city as Trik&#250;&#7789;a.

 </p><p>With reference to the third suggestion that the Traik&#250;&#7789;akas twice overthrew the Kshatrapas, under &#205;&#347;varadatta in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;248 and under Rudraga&#7751;a in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;310&#8211;320, it is to be noted that there is no evidence to show that &#205;&#347;varadatta was either an &#193;bh&#237;ra or a Traik&#250;&#7789;aka and that the identification of his date with <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;248&#8211;250 seems less probable than with either <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;244 or <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;236. (Compare above Footnote page 53). Even if &#205;&#347;varadatta&#8217;s supremacy coincided with <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;250 the initial date of the Traik&#250;&#7789;aka era, it seems improbable that a king who reigned only two years and left no successor should have had any connection with the establishment of an era which is not found in use till two centuries later. As regards Rudraga&#7751;a it may be admitted that he belonged to the race or family who weakened Kshatrapa power early in the fourth century <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi> At the same time there seems no reason to suppose that Rudraga&#7751;a was a Traik&#250;&#7789;aka or a Kalachuri except the fact that his name, like that of &#346;an&#775;karaga&#7751;a, is a compound of the word <hi>ga&#7751;a</hi> and a name of &#346;iva; while the irregular posthumous use of the title Mah&#225;kshatrapa among the latest (23rd to 26th) Kshatrapas favours the view that they remained independent till their overthrow by the Guptas about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;410. The conclusion seems to be that the Traik&#250;&#7789;aka and the Kalachuri eras are the same namely <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;248&#8211;9: that this era was introduced into Gujar&#225;t by the Traik&#250;&#7789;akas who were connected with the Haihayas; and that the introduction of the era into Gujar&#225;t did not take place before the middle of the fifth century <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#8212;(A.

According to the inscriptions Gupta was succeeded by his son Gha&#7789;otkacha a petty chief like his father with the title of Mah&#225;r&#225;ja and without coins.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Chandragupta I. <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;349&#8211;369(?).</note>Chandragupta I. (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;349&#8211;369 [?]), the son and successor of Gha&#7789;otkacha, is styled Mah&#225;r&#225;j&#225;dhir&#225;ja either because he himself became powerful, or, more probably, because he was the father of his very powerful successor Samudragupta. Though he may not have gained the dignity of &#8220;supreme ruler of great kings&#8221; by his own successes Chandragupta I. rose to a higher position than his predecessors. He was connected by marriage with the Lichchhavi dynasty of Tirh&#250;t an alliance which must have been considered of importance since his son Samudragupta puts the name of his mother <corr sic="Kum&#225;r&#225;dev&#237;">Kum&#225;radev&#237;</corr> on his coins, and always styles himself daughter&#8217;s son of Lichchhavi.<note id="n61.4" n="4"><p>Fleet&#8217;s <abbr>Corp. Ins. Ind.</abbr> III. 135. Mr. Fleet believes that the Lichchhavi family concerned was that of Nep&#225;l, and that they were the real founders of the era used by the Guptas. Dr. B&#252;hler (Vienna Or. Journal, V. Pt. 3) holds that Chandragupta married into the Lichchhavi family of P&#225;&#7789;aliputra, and became king of that country in right of his wife. The coins which bear the name of <corr sic="Kum&#225;radevi">Kum&#225;radev&#237;</corr> are by Mr. Smith (<abbr expan="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> (<abbr expan="New Series">N.

On the K&#225;cha coins see below page 62 note 2.

 </p><p>The Lichchhavis claim to be sprung from the solar dynasty. Manu (Burnell&#8217;s Manu, <pb/>308) describes them as descended from a degraded Kshatriya. Beal (<abbr>R. A. S.</abbr> <abbr expan="New Series">N. S.</abbr> XIV. 39) would identify them with an early wave of the Yuechi or Kush&#225;ns; Smith (<abbr expan="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> XX. 55 n. 2) and Hewitt (<abbr expan="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> XX. 355&#8211;366) take them to be a Kolarian or local tribe. The fame of the Lichchhavis of Va&#237;s&#225;li or Passal&#230; between Patna and Tirh&#250;t goes back to the time of Gautama Buddha (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;480) in whose funeral rites the Lichchhavis and their neighbours and associates the Mallas took a prominent share (Rockhill&#8217;s Life of Buddha, 62&#8211;63, 145, 203. Compare Legge&#8217;s Fa Hien, 71&#8211;76; Beal&#8217;s Buddhist Records, II. 67, 70, 73, 77 and 81 note). According to Buddhist writings the first king of Thibet (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;50) who was elected by the chiefs of the South Thibet tribes was a Lichchhavi the son of Prasenadjit of Ko&#347;ala (Rockhill&#8217;s Life of Buddha, 208). Between the seventh and ninth centuries (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;635&#8211;854) a family of Lichchhavis was ruling in Nepal (Fleet&#8217;s <abbr>Corp. Ins. Ind.</abbr> III. 134). The earliest historical member of the Nep&#225;l family is Jayadeva I. whose date is supposed to be about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;330 to 355. Mr. Fleet (Ditto, 135) suggests that Jayadeva&#8217;s reign began earlier and may be the epoch from which the Gupta era of <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;318&#8211;319 is taken. He holds (Ditto, 136) that in all probability the so-called Gupta era is a Lichchhavi era.</p></note>

His numerous gold coins are, with a certain additional Indian element, adopted from those of his Indo-Skythian predecessors. The details of the royal figure on the obverse are Indian in the neck ornaments, large earrings, and headdress; they are Indo-Skythian in the tailed coat, long boots, and straddle. The goddess on the reverse of some coins with a fillet and cornucopia is an adaptation of an Indo-Skythian figure, while the lotus-holding Ganges on an alligator and the standing Glory holding a flyflapper on the reverse of other coins are purely Indian.<note id="n62.1" n="1">The figure of the Ganges standing on an alligator with a stalked lotus in her left hand on the reverse of the gold coins of Samudragupta the fourth king of the dynasty may be taken to be the &#346;ri or Luck of the Guptas.

 </p><p><note place="margin"><hi>His Coins.</hi></note>A noteworthy feature of Samudragupta&#8217;s coins is that one or other of almost all his epithets appears on each of his coins with a figure of the king illustrating the epithet. Coins with the epithet <hi>Sarvar&#225;jochchhett&#225;</hi> Destroyer-of-all-kings have on the obverse a standing king stretching out a banner topped by the wheel or disc of universal supremacy.<note id="n62.2" n="2">The presence of the two letters <foreign lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">&#2325; &#2330;</foreign> that is <hi>ka cha</hi> on the obverse under the arm of the royal figure, has led the late Mr. Thomas, General Cunningham, and Mr. Smith to suppose that the coins belonged to Gha&#7789;otkacha, the last two letters of the name being the same. This identification seems improbable. Gha&#7789;otkacha was never powerful enough to have a currency of his own. <hi>Sarvar&#225;jochchhett&#225;</hi> the attribute on the reverse is one of Samudragupta&#8217;s epithets, while the figure of the king on the obverse grasping the standard with the disc, illustrating the attribute of universal sovereignty, can refer to none other than Samudragupta the first very powerful king of the dynasty. Perhaps the Kacha or K&#225;cha on these coins is a pet or child name of Samudragupta. Mr. Rapson (Numismatic Chron. 3rd Ser. XI. 48ff) has recently suggested that the K&#225;cha coins belong to an elder brother and predecessor of Samudragupta. But it seems unlikely that a ruler who could justly claim the title Destroyer-of-all-kings should be passed over in silence in the genealogy. Further, as is remarked above, the title <hi>Sarvar&#225;jochchhett&#225;</hi> belongs in the inscriptions to Samudragupta alone: and the fact that in his lifetime Samudragupta&#8217;s father chose him as successor is against his exclusion from the throne even for a time.</note>

Sh&#225;h&#225;nush&#225;hi is the oldest, as it appears on the coins from Kanishka downwards in the form Sh&#225;han&#225;no Sh&#225;ho (Stein in Babylonian and Oriental Record, I. 163). It represents the old Persian title Sh&#225;hansh&#225;h or king of kings.

Unless it refers to the last remnants of the Gujar&#225;t Mah&#225;kshatrapas the word &#346;aka seems to be used in a vague sense in reference to the non-Indian tribes of the North-West frontier.

The list of Dakhan and South Indian kingdoms does not necessarily imply that they formed part of Samudragupta&#8217;s territory. Samudragupta may have made a victorious campaign to the far south and had the countries recorded in the order of his line of march. The order suggests that he went from Beh&#225;r, by way of Gay&#225;, to Kosala the country about the modern R&#225;ipur in the Central Provinces, and from Kosala, by Ganjam and other places in the Northern Circars, as far as K&#225;&#241;ch&#237; or Conjeveram forty-six miles south-west of Madras.

He was the first Gupta ruler who spread his power over M&#225;lwa and Gujar&#225;t which he apparently took from the Kshatrapas as he was the first Gupta to strike silver coins and as his silver coins of both varieties the eastern and the western are modifications of the Kshatrapa type.

An undated inscription in the Udayagiri caves at Vidi&#347;&#225; (the modern Besnagar) near Bhilsa records the making of a cave of Mah&#225;deva by one &#346;&#225;ba of the Kautsa gotra and the family name of V&#237;rasena, a poet and native of P&#225;&#7789;aliputra who held the hereditary office of minister of peace and war <hi>sandhivigrahika</hi>, and who is recorded to have arrived with the king who was intent upon conquering the whole earth.<note id="n65.1" n="1"><abbr>Corp.

Ins. 33) prefers to take Devar&#225;ja to be the name of Chandragupta&#8217;s minister.</note> The donor a feudatory of Chandragupta named &#193;mrak&#225;rdava is described as having the object of his life gratified by the favour of the feet of the supreme ruler of great kings the illustrious Chandragupta, and as showing to the world the hearty loyalty of a good feudatory. &#193;mrak&#225;rdava seems to have been a chief of consequence as he is described as winning the flag of glory in numerous battles. The name of his kingdom is also recorded. Though it cannot now be made out the mention of his kingdom makes it probable that he was a stranger come to pay homage to Chandragupta. The reference to Chandragupta seems to imply he was the ruler of the land while the two other inscriptions show that his rule lasted from about 80 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;399) to at least 93 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;412). During these years Chandragupta seems to have spread his sway to Ujjain the capital of west M&#225;lwa, of which he is traditionally called the ruler. From Ujjain by way of B&#225;gh and T&#225;nda in the province of R&#225;th he seems to have entered South Gujar&#225;t and to have passed from the Broach coast to K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a. He seems to have wrested K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a from its Kshatrapa rulers as he is the first Gupta who struck silver coins and as his silver coins are of the then current Kshatrapa type. On the obverse is the royal bust with features copied from the Kshatrapa face and on the reverse is the figure of a peacock, probably chosen as the bearer of K&#225;rtikasv&#225;mi the god of war. Round the peacock is a Sanskrit legend. This legend is of two varieties. In Central Indian coins it runs:

 </p><p>Several gold coins of Chandragupta show a young male figure behind the king with his right hand laid on the king&#8217;s shoulder. This youthful figure is apparently Chandragupta&#8217;s son Kum&#225;ragupta who may have acted as Yuvar&#225;ja during the conquest of M&#225;lwa. <pb id="pb67" n="67"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter VII.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Guptas, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;410&#8211;470.</hi></item><item>Chandragupta II, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;396&#8211;415.</item></list> </fw>The rareness of Chandragupta&#8217;s and the commonness of Kum&#225;ragupta&#8217;s coins in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a, together with the date 90 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;409) on some of <corr sic="Kumar&#225;gupta&#8217;s">Kum&#225;ragupta&#8217;s</corr> coins make it probable that on their conquest his father appointed Kum&#225;ragupta viceroy of Gujar&#225;t and K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a.

 </p><p>As the first Gupta was a chief of no great power or influence it is probable that though it is calculated from him the Gupta era was established not by him but by his grandson the great Chandragupta II.<note id="n67.1" n="1">Mr. Fleet (<abbr>Corp. Ins. Ind.</abbr> III. Introd. 130ff) argues that the era was borrowed from Nepal after Chandragupta I. married his Lichchhavi queen. Dr. B&#252;hler thinks there is no evidence of this, and that the era was started by the Guptas themselves (Vienna Or. Jl. V. Pt. 3).</note> This view is confirmed by the absence of dates on all existing coins of Chandragupta&#8217;s father Samudragupta. It further seems probable that like the M&#225;lavas in <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;57 and the Kshatrapas in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;78 the occasion on which Chandragupta established the Gupta era was his conquest of M&#225;lwa. The Gupta era did not remain long in use. After the fall of Gupta power (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;470) the old M&#225;lava era of <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;57 was revived. The conjecture may be offered that, in spite of the passing away of Gupta power, under his title of Vikram&#225;ditya, the fame of the great Gupta conqueror Chandragupta II. lived on in M&#225;lwa and that, drawing to itself tales of earlier local champions, the name Vikram&#225;ditya came to be considered the name of the founder of the M&#225;lava era.<note id="n67.2" n="2">The further suggestion may be offered that if as seems probable Dr. Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l is correct in considering Chandragupta II. to be the founder of the Gupta era this high honour was due not to his conquest of M&#225;lwa but to some success against the Indo-Skythians or &#346;akas of the Punj&#225;b. The little more than nominal suzerainty claimed over the Devputras, Sh&#225;his, and Sh&#225;h&#225;nush&#225;his in Chandragupta&#8217;s father&#8217;s inscription shows that when he came to the throne Chandragupta found the &#346;aka power practically unbroken. The absence of reference to conquests is no more complete in the case of the Panj&#225;b than it is in the case of Gujar&#225;t or of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a which Chandragupta is known to have added to his dominions. In K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a, though not in Gujar&#225;t, the evidence from coins is stronger than in the Panj&#225;b. Still the discovery of Chandragupta&#8217;s coins (<abbr expan="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> XXI. 5 note 1) raises the presumption of conquests as far north and west as <corr sic="Panipat">P&#225;nipat</corr> and as Ludhi&#225;na (in the heart of the Panj&#225;b). Chandragupta&#8217;s name Devar&#225;ja may, as Pandit Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l suggests, be taken from the &#346;aka title Devaputra. Further, the use of the name Vikram&#225;ditya and of the honorific &#346;r&#237; is in striking agreement with Beruni&#8217;s statement (Sachau, II. 6) that the conqueror of the &#346;akas was named Vikram&#225;ditya and that to the conqueror&#8217;s name was added the title &#346;r&#237;. Mr. Fleet (<abbr>Corp. Ins. Ind.</abbr> III. 37 note 2) holds it not improbable that either Chandragupta I. or II. defeated the Indo-Skythians. The fact that Chandragupta I. was not a ruler of sufficient importance to issue coins and that even after his son Samudragupta&#8217;s victories the &#346;akas remained practically independent make it almost certain that if any subjection of the &#346;akas to the Guptas took place it happened during the reign of Chandragupta II.</note>

 </p><p>Working back from Gupta Sam&#803;vat 80 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;400) the date of Chandragupta&#8217;s conquest of M&#225;lwa we may allot 1 to 12 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;319&#8211;332) to the founder Gupta: 12 to 29 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;332&#8211;349) to Gupta&#8217;s son Gha&#7789;otkacha: 29 to 49 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;349&#8211;369) to Gha&#7789;otkacha&#8217;s son Chandragupta I.: and 50 to 75 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;370&#8211;395) to Chandragupta&#8217;s powerful son Samudragupta who probably had a long reign. As the latest known date of Chandragupta II. is 93 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;413) and as a Bilsa&#7693; inscription<note id="n67.3" n="3"><abbr>Corp. Ins. Ind.</abbr> III. Ins. 10.</note> of his successor Kum&#225;ragupta is dated 96 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;416) the reign of Chandragupta II. may be calculated to have lasted during the twenty years ending 95 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;415).

On Kum&#225;ragupta&#8217;s coins three titles occur: Mahendra, Mahendra-Vikrama, and Mahendr&#225;ditya. As already noticed the circulation of Kum&#225;ragupta&#8217;s coins in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a during his father&#8217;s reign makes it probable that on their conquest his father appointed him viceroy of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a and Gujar&#225;t. <corr sic="Kumar&#225;gupta">Kum&#225;ragupta</corr> appears to have succeeded his father about 96 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;416). An inscription at Mankuw&#225;r near Pray&#225;ga shows he was ruling as late as 129 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;449) and a coin of his dated 130 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;450) adds at least one year to his reign. On the other hand the inscription on the Girn&#225;r rock shows that in 137 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;457) his son Skandagupta was king. It follows that Kum&#225;ragupta&#8217;s reign ended between 130 and 137 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;450&#8211;457) or about 133 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;453).

 </p><p>Large numbers of Kum&#225;ragupta&#8217;s coins of gold silver and copper have been found. The gold which are of various types are inferior in workmanship to his father&#8217;s coins. The silver and copper coins are of two varieties, eastern and western. Both varieties have on the obverse the royal bust in the Kshatrapa style of dress. In the western pieces the bust is a copy of the moustached Kshatrapa face with a corrupted version of the corrupt Greek legend used by the Kshatrapas. The only difference between the obverses of the Western Gupta and the Kshatrapa coins is that the date is in the Gupta instead of in the Kshatrapa era. On the reverse is an ill formed peacock facing front as in Chandragupta II.&#8217;s coins. The legend runs:

Mandalika&#8217;s temple was repaired by Amarji Div&#225;n of Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h (1759&#8211;1784). It was proposed to make and consecrate new images. But certain old images of Vish&#7751;u were found in digging foundations for the enclosure wall and were consecrated. Two of these images were taken by Girn&#225;ra Br&#225;hmans and consecrated in the names of Baladevji and Revat&#237; in a neighbouring temple specially built for them. Of the original temple the only trace is a pilaster built into the wall to the right as one enters. The style and carving are of the Gupta period.

 </p><p>As almost all the Gupta coins found in Cutch are Skandagupta&#8217;s and very few are Kum&#225;ragupta&#8217;s, Skandagupta seems to have added Cutch to the provinces of Gujar&#225;t and K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a inherited from his father. In K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a Skandagupta&#8217;s coins are rare, apparently because of the abundant currency left by his father which was so popular in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a that fresh Kum&#225;ragupta coins of a degraded type were issued as late as Valabhi times.

 </p><p>Like his father, Skandagupta issued a gold coinage in his eastern dominions but no trace of a gold currency appears in the west. Like Kum&#225;ragupta&#8217;s his silver coins were of two varieties, eastern and western. The eastern coins have on the obverse a bust as in Kum&#225;ragupta&#8217;s coins and the date near the face. On the reverse is a peacock similar to Kum&#225;ragupta&#8217;s and round the peacock the legend:

 </p><p>Skandagupta&#8217;s western coins are of three varieties, one the same as the western coins of Kum&#225;ragupta, a second with a bull instead of a peacock on the reverse, and a third with on the reverse an altar with one upright and two side jets of water. Coins of the first two varieties are found both in Gujar&#225;t and in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a. The third water-jet variety is peculiar to Cutch and is an entirely new feature in the western Gupta coinage. On the reverse of all is the legend:

 </p><p>Since the coins are dated Sam&#803;vat 174 and 180 odd (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;494 and 500 odd) and the inscription&#8217;s date is 165 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;485) the inscription may be taken to belong to the early part of Budhagupta&#8217;s reign the beginning of which may be allotted to about 160&#8211;162 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;480&#8211;482). As this is more than ten years later than the latest known date of Skandagupta (G. 149 <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;469) either a Gupta of whom no trace remains must have intervened or the twelve blank years must have been a time of political change and disturbance. The absence of any trace of a gold currency suggests that Budhagupta had less power than his predecessors. The correctness of this argument is placed beyond doubt by the pillar inscription opposite the shrine in the Era&#7751; temple where instead of his predecessor&#8217;s title of monarch of the whole earth Budhagupta is styled protector of the land between the Jamna (K&#225;lind&#237;) and the <corr sic="Narb&#225;d&#225;">Narbad&#225;</corr> implying the loss of the whole territory to the east of the Jamna.<note id="n71.5" n="5">It is now known that the main Gupta line continued to rule in Magadha. See page 73 below.</note> In the west the failure of Gupta power seems still more complete. Neither in Gujar&#225;t nor in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a has an inscription or even a coin been found with a reference to Budhagupta or to any other Gupta ruler later than Skandagupta (G. 149 <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;469). The pillar inscription noted above which is of the year 165 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;485) and under the rule of Budhagupta states that the pillar was a gift to the temple by Dhanya Vish&#7751;u and his brother M&#225;t&#7771;i Vish&#7751;u who at the time of the gift seem to have been local Br&#225;hman governors. A second inscription on the lower part of the neck of a huge Boar or Var&#225;ha image in a corner shrine of the same temple records that the image was completed on the tenth day of Ph&#225;lguna in the first year of the reign of <pb id="pb72" n="72"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter VII.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Guptas, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;410&#8211;470.</hi></item><item><corr sic="Bhudagupta">Budhagupta</corr>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;485.</item></list> </fw>Toram&#225;&#7751;a the supreme ruler of great kings and was the gift of the same Dhanya Vish&#7751;u whose brother M&#225;t&#7771;i Vish&#7751;u is described as gone to heaven.<note id="n72.1" n="1">Published by Mr. Fleet <abbr>Corp. Ins. Ind.</abbr> III. Ins. 36.</note> Since M&#225;t&#7771;i was alive in the Budhagupta and was dead in the Toram&#225;&#7751;a inscription it follows that Toram&#225;&#7751;a was later than Budhagupta. His name and his new era show that Toram&#225;&#7751;a was not a Gupta. A further proof that Toram&#225;&#7751;a wrested the kingdom from Budhagupta is that except the change of era and that the bust turns to the left instead of to the right, Toram&#225;&#7751;a&#8217;s silver coins are directly adapted from Gupta coins of the eastern type. Certain coin dates seem at variance with the view that Toram&#225;&#7751;a flourished after Budhagupta. On several coins the date 52 is clear. As Toram&#225;&#7751;a&#8217;s coins are copies of the coins of Kum&#225;ragupta and Skandagupta and as most of these coins have a numeral for one hundred the suggestion may be offered that a one dropped out in striking Toram&#225;&#7751;a&#8217;s die and that this date should read 152 not 52. Accepting this view Toram&#225;&#7751;a&#8217;s date would be 152 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;472) that is immediately after the death of Skandagupta.

 </p><p>The Gw&#225;lior inscription<note id="n72.2" n="2">Fleet <abbr>Corp. Ins. Ind.</abbr> III.

Ins. 35.</note> dated M&#225;lava Sam&#803;vat 589 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;533) mentions a king named Ya&#347;odharman who was ruler of M&#225;lwa when the well was built and who in a second Mandasor inscription<note id="n72.4" n="4">Fleet <abbr>Corp. Ins. Ind.</abbr> III. Ins. 33.</note> is mentioned as having conquered Mihirakula. This would separate Mihirakula from his father Toram&#225;&#7751;a (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;471) by more than sixty years. In explanation of this gap it may be suggested that the [1]52 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;472) coins were struck early in Toram&#225;&#7751;a&#8217;s reign in honour of his conquest of the eastern Gupta territory. A reign of twenty years would bring Toram&#225;&#7751;a to 177 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;497). The Gw&#225;lior inscription of Mihirakula is in the fifteenth year of his reign that is on the basis of a succession date of 177 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;497) in Gupta 192 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;512). An interval of five years would bring Ya&#347;odharman&#8217;s conquest of Mihirakula to 197 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;517). This would place the making of the well in the twenty-first year of Mihirakula&#8217;s reign.

 </p><p>The sense of the inscription is somewhat doubtful. Mr. Fleet (<abbr>Corp. Ins. Ind.</abbr> III. page 62) translates: Whose fame, moreover, even (his) enemies in the countries of the Mlechchhas ... having their pride broken down to the very root announce with the words &#8216;Verily the victory has been achieved by him.&#8217; Prof. Peterson understands the meaning to be that Skandagupta&#8217;s Indian enemies were forced to retire beyond the borders of India among friendly Mlechchhas and in a foreign land admit that the renewal of their conflict with Skandagupta was beyond hope. The retreat of Skandagupta&#8217;s Indian enemies to the Mlechchhas suggests the Mlechchhas are the H&#250;&#7751;as that is the White Huns who were already in power on the Indian border, whom the enemies had previously in vain brought as allies into India to help them against Skandagupta. This gives exactness to the expression used in Skandagupta&#8217;s Bhitari inscription (<abbr>Corp. Ins. Ind.</abbr> III. Number 13 page 56) that he joined in close conflict with the H&#250;&#7751;as ... among enemies, as if in this conflict the H&#250;&#7751;as were the allies of enemies rather than the enemies themselves. For the introduction into India of foreign allies, compare in <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;327 (McCrindle&#8217;s Alexander in India, 412) the king of Taxila, 34 miles north-west of R&#225;walpindi, sending an embassy to Baktria to secure Alexander as an ally against Porus of the Gujar&#225;t country.

That the Mlechchhas of this passage refers to the Huns is made probable by the fact that it does not appear that the Pushyamitras were Mlechchhas while they and the Huns are the only enemies whom Skandagupta boasts either of defeating or of meeting in close conflict. It may therefore be assumed that the Huns became known to Skandagupta before <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;455.

 </p><p><note place="margin">White Huns, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;450&#8211;520.</note>Among the northerners who with or shortly after the Pushyamitras shared in the overthrow of Gupta power two names, a father and a son, Toram&#225;&#7751;a and Mihirakula are prominent. It is not certain that these kings were H&#250;&#7751;as by race. Their tribe were almost certainly his rivals&#8217; allies whom Skandagupta&#8217;s Bhitari and Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h inscriptions style the one H&#250;&#7751;as the other Mlechchhas.<note id="n74.5" n="5">See above notes 1 and 2.</note> On one of Toram&#225;&#7751;a&#8217;s coins Mr. Fleet reads<note id="n74.6" n="6"><abbr>Ind.

If his father reigned fifty-two years he must have been at least 70 when he died and not less than 45 when Mihirakula was born. As Mihirakula is known to have had at least one younger brother,<note id="n74.10" n="10">Beale&#8217;s Hiuen Tsiang, I. 169&#8211;171. As Mr. Fleet suggests the younger brother is possibly the Chandra referred to in <abbr>Corp. Ins. Ind.</abbr> III.

The suggestion may be offered that that event was the establishment of the White Huns in Baktria and the founding of their capital Badeghis,<note id="n74.12" n="12">Specht in Journal Asiatique for Oct.&#8211;Dec. 1883. <foreign lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire des Wei</foreign>.</note> which, as fixed above between <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;452 and 455, gives the very suitable date of <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;504 to 507 for the 52 of Toram&#225;&#7751;a&#8217;s coin.

Hiuen Tsiang&#8217;s statement (Ditto) that Mihirakula conquered Gandh&#225;ra after his capture by B&#225;l&#225;ditya may refer to a reconquest from his brother, perhaps the Chandra referred to in note 10 on page 74.</note> and Sungyun&#8217;s description of the king&#8217;s pride and activity agrees well with other records of Mihirakula&#8217;s character. It seems therefore reasonable to suppose that the warlike sovereign who treated Sungyun and the name of his Imperial mistress with such scant courtesy was no other than the meteor Mihirakula. If Sungyun is correct in stating that Mihirakula was the third of his line the dynasty must have been established about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;460.

Sungyun&#8217;s reference to the establishment of this dynasty suggests they were not White Huns but leaders of some subject tribe.<note id="n75.5" n="5">Beal&#8217;s Buddhist Records, I. xcix.-c.

Of the progress of the mixed Yuan-Yuan and White Hun invaders in India few details are available.

As regards the change from Kula to Gollas it is to be noted that certain of Mihirakula&#8217;s own coins (<abbr>Ind.

Of this Gollas, who, like Mihirakula, was the type of conqueror round whom legends gather, Cosmas says (Priaulx, 223): Besides a great force of cavalry Gollas could bring into the field 2000 elephants. So large were his armies that once when besieging an inland town defended by a water-fosse his men horses and elephants drank the water and marched in dry-shod.</note>

That dynasty is the famous family of Ujjain to which belonged the well known Vikram&#225;ditya of the Nine Gems. It may be conjectured not only that Ya&#347;odharman belonged to this family but that Ya&#347;odharman was the great Vikram&#225;ditya himself.<note id="n77.6" n="6">This has already been suggested by <abbr>Genl.</abbr> Cunningham, <abbr>Num.

It is clear that Mihirakula&#8217;s first defeat was at the hands of Ya&#347;odharman about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;530. His defeat and capture by B&#225;l&#225;ditya must have been later. As Skandagupta&#8217;s reign ended about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;470 a blank of sixty years has to be filled by the two reigns of his brother and his nephew.<note id="n77.11" n="11">H&#339;rnle makes light of this difficulty: J. B. A. S. LVIII. 97.</note> This, though not impossible, suggests caution in identifying B&#225;l&#225;ditya. According to Hiuen Tsiang B&#225;l&#225;ditya was a feudatory of Mihirakula who rebelled against him when he began to persecute the Buddhists. Hiuen Tsiang notices that, at the intercession of his own mother, B&#225;l&#225;ditya spared Mihirakula&#8217;s life and allowed him to retire to Kashmir. He further notices that Mihirakula and his brother were rivals and his statement suggests that from Kashmir Mihirakula defeated his brother and recovered Gandh&#225;ra.

The modern name of Valabhi is Val&#803;eh. It is impossible to say whether the modern Val&#803;eh is a corruption of Valahi the Prakrit form of the Sanskrit Valabhi or whether Valabhi is Sanskritised from a local original Val&#803;eh. The form Valahi occurs in the writings of Jinaprabhasuri a learned Jain of the thirteenth century who describes &#346;atru&#241;jaya as in the Val&#225;haka province. A town in the chiefship of Val&#803;eh now occupies the site of old Valabhi,<note id="n78.1" n="1">Mr. Vajeshankar Gavrishankar, N&#225;ib Div&#225;n of Bh&#225;vnagar, has made a collection of articles found in Valabhi. The collection includes clay seals of four varieties and of about the seventh century with the Buddhist formula <hi>Ye Dh&#225;rma hetu Prabhav&#225;</hi>: a small earthen tope with the same formula imprinted on its base with a seal; beads and ring stones <hi>nangs</hi> of several varieties of <hi>akik</hi> or carnelian and <hi>sphatik</hi> or coral some finished others half finished showing that as in modern Cambay the polishing of carnelians was a leading industry in early Valabhi.

The dynastic name is lost. The names on these moveable objects need not belong to Valabhi history. Still that seals of the second and fifth centuries have been discovered in Valabhi shows the place was in existence before the founding of the historical Valabhi kingdom. A further proof of the age of the city is the mention of it in the Kath&#225;sarit-s&#225;gara a comparatively modern work but of very old materials. To this evidence of age, with much hesitation, may be added Balai Ptolemy&#8217;s name for Gopn&#225;th point which suggests that as early as the second century Val&#803;eh or Baleh (compare Alberuni&#8217;s era of Balah) was known by its present name. Badly minted coins of the Gupta ruler Kum&#225;ragupta (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;417&#8211;453) are so common as to suggest that they were the currency of Valabhi.</note> whose ruins lie buried below thick layers of black earth and silt under the modern town and its neighbourhood. The only remains of old buildings are the large foundation bricks of which, except a few new houses, the whole of Val&#803;eh is built. The absence of stone supports the theory that the buildings of old Valabhi were of brick and wood. In 1872 when the site was examined the only stone remains were a few scattered Lin&#775;gas and a well-polished life-size granite Nandi or bull lying near a modern Mah&#225;deva temple. Diggers for old bricks have found copper pots and copperplates and small Buddhist relic shrines with earthen pots and clay seals of the seventh century.

 </p><p>The ruins of Valabhi show few signs of representing a large or important city. The want of sweet water apparently unfits the site for the capital of so large a kingdom as Valabhi. Its choice as capital was probably due to its being a harbour on the Bh&#225;vnagar creek. Since <pb id="pb79" n="79"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter VIII.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Valabhis, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;509&#8211;766.</hi></item><item>Val&#803;eh Town, 1893.</item></list> </fw>the days of Valabhi&#8217;s prime the silt which thickly covers the ruins has also filled and choked the channel which once united it with the Bh&#225;vnagar creek when the small Ghelo was probably a fair sized river.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Valabhi in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;630</note>In spite of the disappearance of every sign of greatness Hiuen Tsiang&#8217;s (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;640) details show how rich and populous Valabhi was in the early part of the seventh century. The country was about 1000 miles (6000 <hi>li</hi>) and the capital about five miles (30 <hi>li</hi>) in circumference. The soil the climate and the manners of the people were like those of M&#225;lava. The population was dense; the religious establishments rich. Over a hundred merchants owned a hundred <hi>l&#225;khs</hi>. The rare and valuable products of distant regions were stored in great quantities. In the country were several hundred monasteries or <hi>sangh&#225;r&#225;mas</hi> with about 6000 monks. Most of them studied the Little Vehicle according to the Sammatiya school. There were several hundred temples of Devas and sectaries of many sorts. When Tath&#225;gata or Gautama Buddha (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;560&#8211;480) lived he often travelled through this country. King A&#347;oka (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;240) had raised monuments or <hi>st&#250;pas</hi> in all places where Buddha had rested. Among these were spots where the three past Buddhas sat or walked or preached. At the time of Hiuen Tsiang&#8217;s account (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;640) the king was of the Kshatriya caste, as all Indian rulers were. He was the nephew of &#346;&#237;l&#225;ditya of M&#225;lava and the son-in-law of the son of &#346;&#237;l&#225;ditya the reigning king of Kany&#225;kubja. His name was Dhruvapa&#7789;u (Tu-lu-h&#8217;o-po-tu). He was of a lively and hasty disposition, shallow in wisdom and statecraft. He had only recently attached himself sincerely to the faith in the three precious ones. He yearly summoned a great assembly and during seven days gave away valuable gems and choice meats. On the monks he bestowed in charity the three garments and medicaments, or their equivalents in value, and precious articles made of the seven rare and costly gems. These he gave in charity and redeemed at twice their price. He esteemed the virtuous, honoured the good, and revered the wise. Learned priests from distant regions were specially honoured. Not far from the city was a great monastery built by the Arhat &#193;ch&#225;ra (&#8217;O-che-lo), where, during their travels, the Bodhisattvas Gunamati and Sthiramati (Kien-hwni) settled and composed renowned treatises.<note id="n79.1" n="1">As suggested by Dr. B&#252;hler (<abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> VI. 10), this is probably the Vih&#225;ra called &#346;r&#237; Bappap&#225;diyavih&#225;ra which is described as having been constructed by &#193;ch&#225;rya Bhadanta Sthiramati who is mentioned as the grantee in a copperplate of Dharasena II. bearing date Gupta 269 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;588). The Sthiramati mentioned with titles of religious veneration in the copperplate is probably the same as that referred to by Hiuen Tsiang. (Ditto).</note>

 </p><p><note place="margin">Valabhi Copperplates.</note>The only historical materials regarding the Valabhi dynasty are their copperplates of which a large number have been found. That such powerful rulers as the Valabhis should leave no records on stones and no remains of religious or other buildings is probably because, with one possible exception at Gopn&#225;th,<note id="n79.2" n="2">Burgess&#8217; K&#225;thi&#225;w&#225;r and Kutch, 187.</note> up to the ninth century all temples and religious buildings in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a and Gujar&#225;t were of brick and wood.<note id="n79.3" n="3">Stories on record about two temples one at &#346;atru&#241;jaya the other at Soman&#225;tha support this view. As regards the <corr sic="S&#225;tru&#241;jaya">&#346;atru&#241;jaya</corr> temple the tradition is that while the minister of <corr sic="Kumarap&#225;la">Kum&#225;rap&#225;la</corr> (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1143&#8211;1174) of <corr sic="Anahilav&#225;&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a</corr> was on a visit to &#346;atru&#241;jaya to worship and meditate in the temple of &#193;din&#225;tha, the wick of the lamp in the shrine was removed <pb/>by mice and set on fire and almost destroyed the temple which was wholly of wood. The minister seeing the danger of wooden buildings determined to erect a stone edifice (<hi>Kum&#225;rap&#225;la Charita</hi>). The story about Soman&#225;tha is given in an inscription of the time of Kum&#225;rap&#225;la in the temple of Bhadrak&#225;li which shows that before the stone temple was built by Bh&#237;madeva I. (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1022&#8211;1072) the structure was of wood which was traditionally believed to be as old as the time of K&#7771;ish&#7751;a.

All are in one style two plates inscribed breadthwise on the inner side, the earliest plates being the smallest. The plates are held together by two rings passed through two holes in their horizontal upper margin. One of the rings bears on one side a seal with, as a badge of the religion of the dynasty, a well-proportioned seated Nandi or bull. Under the bull is the word Bha&#7789;&#225;rka the name of the founder of the dynasty. Except such differences as may be traced to the lapse of time, the characters are the same in all, and at the same time differ from the character then in use in the Valabhi territory which must have been that from which Devan&#225;gar&#237; is derived. The Valabhi plate character is adopted from that previously in use in South Gujar&#225;t plates which was taken from the South Indian character. The use of this character suggests that either Bha&#7789;&#225;rka or the clerks and writers of the plates came from South Gujar&#225;t.<note id="n80.1" n="1">The correctness of this inference seems open to question. The descent of the Valabhi plate character seems traceable from its natural local source the Skandagupta (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;450) and the Rudrad&#225;man (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;150) Girn&#225;r Inscriptions.&#8212;(A. M. T. J.)</note> The language of all the grants is Sanskrit prose. Each records the year of the grant, the name of the king making the grant, the name of the grantee, the name of the village or field granted, the name of the writer of the charter either the minister of peace and war <hi lang="sa-latn" xml:lang="sa-latn">sandhivigrah&#225;dhik&#7771;ita</hi> or the military head <hi lang="sa-latn" xml:lang="sa-latn">bal&#225;dhik&#7771;ita</hi>, and sometimes the name of the <hi lang="sa-latn" xml:lang="sa-latn">d&#250;taka</hi> or gift-causer generally some officer of influence or a prince and in one case a princess. The grants begin by recording they were made either &#8216;from Valabhi&#8217; the capital, or &#8216;from the royal camp&#8217; &#8216;<hi lang="sa-latn" xml:lang="sa-latn">Vijayaskandh&#225;v&#225;ra</hi>.&#8217; Then follows the genealogy of the dynasty from Bha&#7789;&#225;rka the founder to the grantor king. Each king has in every grant a series of attributes which appear to have been fixed for him once for all. Except in rare instances the grants contain nothing historical. They are filled with verbose description and figures of speech in high flown Sanskrit. As enjoined in law-books or <hi lang="sa-latn" xml:lang="sa-latn">dharma&#347;&#225;stras</hi> after the genealogy of the grantor comes the name of the composer usually the minister of peace and war and after him the boundaries of the land granted. The plates conclude with the date of the grant, expressed in numerals following the letter <hi lang="sa-latn" xml:lang="sa-latn">sam&#803;</hi> or the letters <hi lang="sa-latn" xml:lang="sa-latn">sam&#803;va</hi> for <hi lang="sa-latn" xml:lang="sa-latn">sam&#803;vatsara</hi> that is year.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Period Covered.</note>So far as is known the dates extend for 240 years from 207 to 447.

No other era seems to have been in use in Valabhi. Three inscriptions have their years dated expressly in the Valabhi Sam&#803;vat. The earliest of these in Bhadrak&#225;li&#8217;s temple in Somn&#225;th P&#225;tan is of the time of Kum&#225;rap&#225;la (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1143&#8211;1174) the <corr sic="Solanki">Solan&#775;ki</corr> ruler of <corr sic="Anahilav&#225;&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a</corr>. It bears date Valabhi Sam&#803;vat 850. The second and third are in the temple of Harsata Devi at Ver&#225;val. The second which was first mentioned by Colonel Tod, is dated Hijra 662, Vikrama Sam&#803;vat 1320, Valabhi Sam&#803;vat 945, and Sim&#803;ha Sam&#803;vat 151. The third inscription, in the same temple on the face of the pedestal of an image of K&#7771;ish&#7751;a represented as upholding the Govardhana hill, bears date Valabhi <abbr>S.</abbr> 927. These facts prove that an era known as the Valabhi era, which the inscriptions show began in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;319, was in use for about a hundred years in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. This may be accepted as the era of the Valabhi plates which extended over two centuries. Further the great authority (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1030) Alberuni gives &#346;aka 241 that is <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;319 as the starting point both of the &#8216;era of Balah&#8217; and of what he calls the Guptak&#225;la or the Gupta era. Beruni&#8217;s accuracy is established by a comparison of the Mandasor inscription and the Nep&#225;l inscription of Am&#347;uvarman which together prove the Gupta era started from <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;319. Though its use by the powerful Valabhi dynasty caused the era to be generally known by their name in Gujar&#225;t in certain localities the Gupta era continued in use under its original name as in the Morb&#237; copperplate of J&#225;ikadeva which bears date 588 &#8220;of the era of the Guptas.&#8221;<note id="n81.1" n="1">The era has been exhaustively discussed by Mr. Fleet in <abbr>Corp.

The Kaira system of assessment was by yield the unit being the <hi>pi&#7789;aka</hi> or basketful, the grants describing fields as capable of growing so many baskets of rice or barley (or as requiring so many baskets of seed). As the grants always specify the Kaira basket a similar system with a different sized basket seems to have been in use in other parts of the country. Another detail which the plates preserve is that each field had its name called after a guardian or from some tree or plant. Among field names are Kotilaka, Atima&#7751;a-ked&#225;ra, Kha&#7751;da-ked&#225;ra, Gargara-kshetra, Bh&#237;ma-kshetra, Khagali-ked&#225;ra, &#346;ami-ked&#225;ra.

Near the pillar, at the steps leading to the water, is a carved doorway of about the tenth or eleventh century with some well-proportioned figures. The left doorpost has at the top a figure of &#346;iva, below the &#346;iva a figure of S&#250;rya, below the S&#250;rya a male and female, and under them attendants or <hi>ga&#7751;as</hi> of &#346;iva. The right doorpost has at the top a figure of Vish&#7751;u seated on Garu&#7693;a, below the seated <corr sic="Vishnu">Vish&#7751;u</corr> a standing Vish&#7751;u with four hands, and below that two sitting male and female figures, the male with hands folded in worship the female holding a purse. These figures probably represent a married pair who paid for this gateway. Further below are figures of <hi>ga&#7751;as</hi> of &#346;iva. In 1884 in repairing the south bank of the pond a number of carved stones were brought from the north of the town. About half a mile north-west of the town on the bank of a dry brook, is a temple of Ch&#225;mund&#225; Dev&#237; of about the tenth century. It contains a mutilated life-size image of Ch&#225;mund&#225;. Facing the temple lie mutilated figures of the seven M&#225;trik&#225;s and of Bhairava, probably the remains of a separate altar <pb/>facing the temple with the <hi>m&#225;tri-ma&#7751;&#7693;ala</hi> or Mother-Meeting upon it. The village has a large modern temple of &#346;iva called Nakle&#347;vara, on the site of some old temple and mostly built of old carved temple stones. In the temple close by are a number of old images of the sun and the boar incarnation of <corr sic="Vishnu">Vish&#7751;u</corr> all of about the tenth or eleventh century. The name Nakle&#347;vara would seem to have been derived from Nakuli&#347;a the founder of the P&#225;&#347;upata sect and the temple may originally have had an image of Nakuli&#347;a himself or a <hi>lin&#775;ga</hi> representing Nakul&#237;&#347;a. Close to the west of the village near a small dry reservoir called the Ku&#7751;&#7693;a of R&#225;jar&#225;je&#347;vara lies a well-preserved black stone seated figure of Cha&#7751;&#7693;a one of the most respected of &#346;iva&#8217;s attendants, without whose worship all worship of &#346;iva is imperfect, and to whom all that remains after making oblations to &#346;iva is offered. A number of other sculptures lie on the bank of the pond. About a mile to the south of K&#225;rv&#225;n is a village called Lingthali the place of <hi>lin&#775;gas</hi>.</note> The special <pb id="pb84" n="84"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter VIII.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Valabhis, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;509&#8211;766.</hi></item><item>Religion.</item></list> </fw>holiness attached to the <corr sic="Narb&#225;d&#225;">Narbad&#225;</corr> in &#346;aivism and to its pebbles as <hi>lin&#775;gas</hi> is probably due to the neighbourhood of this shrine of K&#225;rv&#225;n. The followers of the Nakul&#237;&#347;a-P&#225;&#347;upata school were strict devotees of &#346;aivism, Nakul&#237;&#347;a the founder being regarded as an incarnation of &#346;iva. The date of the foundation of this school is not yet determined. It appears to have been between the second and the fifth century <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi> Nakul&#237;&#347;a had four disciples Ku&#347;ika, G&#225;rgya, K&#225;rusha, and Maitreya founders of four branches which spread through the length and breadth of India. Though no special representatives of this school remain, in spite of their nominal allegiance to &#346;ankar&#225;ch&#225;rya the Da&#347;an&#225;mis or At&#237;ts are in fact Nakul&#237;&#347;as in their discipline doctrines and habits&#8212;applying ashes over the whole body, planting a <hi>lin&#775;ga</hi> over the grave of a buried At&#237;t, and possessing proprietary rights over &#346;aiva temples. The P&#225;&#347;upatas were ever ready to fight for their school and often helped and served in the armies of kings who became their disciples. Till a century ago these unpaid followers recruited the armies of India with celibates firm and strong in fighting. It was apparently to gain these recruits that so many of the old rulers of India became followers of the P&#225;&#347;upata school. To secure their services the rulers had to pay them special respect. The leaders of these fighting monks were regarded as pontiffs like the Bappa-p&#225;da or Pontiff of the later Valabhi and other kings. Thus among the later Valabhis &#346;&#237;l&#225;ditya IV. is called <hi>B&#225;vap&#225;d&#225;nudhy&#225;ta</hi> and all subsequent &#346;&#237;l&#225;dityas <hi>Bappap&#225;d&#225;nudhy&#225;ta</hi> both titles meaning Worshipping at the feet of <corr sic="Bava">B&#225;va</corr> or Bappa.

 </p><p>This B&#225;va is the popular Prakrit form of the older Prakrit or <hi>de&#347;&#237;</hi> Bappa meaning Father or worshipful. Bappa is the original of the Hindust&#225;ni and Gujar&#225;ti B&#225;v&#225; father or elder; it is also a special term for a head Gos&#225;vi or At&#237;t or indeed for any recluse. The epithet <hi>Bappa-p&#225;d&#225;nudhy&#225;ta</hi>, Bowing at the feet of Bappa, occurs in the attributes of several Nep&#225;l kings, and in the case of king Vasantasena appears the full phrase:



     <q rend="align(center)"><p><hi lang="sa-latn" xml:lang="sa-latn">Parama-daivata-bappa-bha&#7789;&#7789;&#225;raka-mah&#225;r&#225;ja-&#346;r&#237;-p&#225;d&#225;nudhy&#225;ta.</hi>

     </p><p>Falling at the illustrious feet of the great Mah&#225;r&#225;ja Lord Bappa.</p></q>



 </p><p rend="noindent">These Nep&#225;l kings were &#346;aivas as they are called <hi>parama-m&#225;he&#347;vara</hi> in the text of the inscription and like the Valabhi seals their seals bear a bull. It follows that the term <hi>Bappa</hi> was applied both by the Valabhis and the Nep&#225;l kings to some one, who can hardly be the same individual, unless he was their <pb id="pb85" n="85"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter VIII.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Valabhis, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;509&#8211;766.</hi></item><item>Religion.</item></list> </fw>common overlord, which the distance between the two countries and still more the fact that his titles are the same as the titles of the Valabhi kings make almost impossible. In these circumstances the most probable explanation of the Bappa or B&#225;va of these inscriptions is that it was applied to Shaivite pontiffs or ecclesiastical dignitaries. The attribute <hi>Parama-daivata</hi> The Great Divine prefixed to Bappa in the inscription of Vasantasena confirms this view. That such royal titles as <hi>Mah&#225;r&#225;j&#225;dhir&#225;ja</hi>, <hi>Paramabha&#7789;&#7789;&#225;raka</hi>, and <hi>Parame&#347;vara</hi> are ascribed to Bappa is in agreement with the present use of Mah&#225;r&#225;ja for all priestly Br&#225;hmans and recluses and of Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#225;raka for Digambara Jain priests. Though specially associated with &#346;aivas the title <hi>bappa</hi> is applied also to Vaishnava dignitaries. That the term <hi>bappa</hi> was in similar use among the Buddhists appears from the title of a Valabhi <hi>vih&#225;ra</hi> Bappap&#225;d&#237;yavih&#225;ra The monastery of the worshipful Bappa that is Of the great teacher Sthiramati by whom it was built.<note id="n85.1" n="1">Compare Beal Buddhist Records, II. 268 note 76 and <abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> VI. 9. The meaning and reference of the title <hi>Bappa</hi> have been much discussed. The question is treated at length by Mr. Fleet (<abbr>Corp. Ins. Ind.</abbr> III. 186 note 1) with the result that the title is applied not to a religious teacher but to the father and predecessor of the king who makes the grant. According to Mr. Fleet <hi>bappa</hi> would be used in reference to a father, <hi>b&#225;va</hi> in reference to an uncle.</note>

 </p><p><note place="margin">Origin of the Valabhis.</note>The tribe or race of Bha&#7789;&#225;rka the founder of the Valabhi dynasty is doubtful. None of the numerous Valabhi copperplates mentions the race of the founder. The Chalukya and R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a copperplates are silent regarding the Valabhi dynasty. And it is worthy of note that the Gehlots and Gohils, who are descended from the Valabhis, take their name not from their race but from king Guha or Guhasena (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;559&#8211;567) the fourth ruler and apparently the first great sovereign among the Valabhis. These considerations make it probable that Bha&#7789;&#225;rka belonged to some low or stranger tribe. Though the evidence falls short of proof the probability seems strong that Bha&#7789;&#225;rka belonged to the Gurjara tribe, and that it was the supremacy of him and his descendants which gave rise to the name Gurjjara-r&#225;tra the country of the Gurjjaras, a name used at first by outsiders and afterwards adopted by the people of Gujar&#225;t. Except Bha&#7789;&#225;rka and his powerful dynasty no kings occur of sufficient importance to have given their name to the great province of Gujar&#225;t. Against their Gurjara origin it may be urged that the Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsiang (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;640) calls the king of Valabhi a Kshatriya. Still Hiuen Tsiang&#8217;s remark was made more than a century after the establishment of the dynasty when their rise to power and influence had made it possible for them to ennoble themselves by calling themselves Kshatriyas and tracing their lineage to <corr sic="Puranic">Pur&#225;&#7751;ic</corr> heroes. That such ennobling was not only possible but common is beyond question. Many so-called R&#225;jput families in Gujar&#225;t and <corr sic="K&#225;thiav&#225;&#7693;a">K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a</corr> can be traced to low or stranger tribes. The early kings of N&#225;ndipur&#237; or N&#225;ndod (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;450) call themselves Gurjjaras and the later members of the same dynasty trace their lineage to the Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata hero Kar&#7751;a. Again two of the <corr sic="Nandod">N&#225;ndod</corr> Gurjjaras Dadda II. and <corr sic="Jayabhata">Jayabha&#7789;a</corr> II. helped the Valabhis under circumstances which suggest that the bond of sympathy <pb id="pb86" n="86"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter VIII.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Valabhis, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;509&#8211;766.</hi></item><item>Origin of the Valabhis.</item></list> </fw>may have been their common origin. The present chiefs of N&#225;ndod derive their lineage from Kar&#7751;a and call themselves Gohils of the same stock as the Bh&#225;vnagar Gohils who admittedly belong to the Valabhi stock. This supports the theory that the Gurjjaras and the Valabhis had a common origin, and that the Gurjjaras were a branch of and tributary to the Valabhis. This would explain how the Valabhis came to make grants in Broach at the time when the Gurjjaras ruled there. It would further explain that the Gurjjaras were called <hi>s&#225;mantas</hi> or feudatories because they were under the overlordship of the Valabhis.<note id="n86.1" n="1">Whether the Valabhis were or were not Gurjjaras the following facts favour the view that they entered Gujar&#225;t from M&#225;lwa. It has been shown (Fleet <abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> XX. 376) that while the Guptas used the so-called Northern year beginning with Chaitra, the Valabhi year began with K&#225;rtika (see <abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> XX. 376). And further Kielhorn in his examination of questions connected with the Vikrama era (<abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> XIX. and XX.) has given reasons for believing that the original Vikrama year began with K&#225;rtika and took its rise in M&#225;lwa. It seems therefore that when they settled in Gujar&#225;t, while they adopted the Gupta era the Valabhis still adhered to the old arrangement of the year to which they had been accustomed in their home in M&#225;lwa. The arrangement of the year entered into every detail of their lives, and was therefore much more difficult to change than the starting point of their era, which was important only for official acts.&#8212;(A.

 </p><p><note place="margin">History.</note>The preceding chapter shows that except Chandragupta (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;410) Kum&#225;ragupta (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;416) and Skandagupta (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;456) none of the Guptas have left any trace of supremacy in Gujar&#225;t and K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a. Of what happened in Gujar&#225;t during the forty years after Gupta 150 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;469), when the reign of Skandagupta came to an end nothing is known or is likely to be discovered from Indian sources. The blank of forty years to the founder Bha&#7789;&#225;rka (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;509) or more correctly of sixty years to Dhruvasena (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;526) the first Valabhi king probably corresponds with the ascendancy of some foreign dynasty or tribe. All trace of this tribe has according to custom been blotted out of the Sanskrit and other Hindu records. At the same time it is remarkable that the fifty years ending about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;525 correspond closely with the ascendancy in north and north-west India of the great tribe of Ephthalites or White Huns. As has been shown in the Gupta Chapter, by <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;470 or 480, the White Huns seem to have been powerful if not supreme in Upper India. In the beginning of the sixth century, perhaps about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;520, Cosmas Indikopleustes describes the north of India and the west coast as far south as Kalliena that is Kaly&#225;n near Bombay as under the Huns whose king was Gollas.<note id="n86.2" n="2">Montfau&#231;on&#8217;s Edition in Priaulx&#8217;s Indian Travels, 222&#8211;223. It seems doubtful if Cosmas meant that Gollas&#8217; overlordship spread as far south as Kaly&#225;n. Compare Migne&#8217;s <foreign lang="la" xml:lang="la">Patrologi&#230; Cursus</foreign>, lxxxviii. 466; Yule&#8217;s Cathay, I. clxx.</note> Not many years later (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;530) the Hun power in Central India suffered defeat and about the same time a new dynasty arose in south-east K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a.

 </p><p><note place="margin">First Valabhi Grant, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;526.</note>The first trace of the new power, the earliest Valabhi grant, is that of Dhruvasena in the Valabhi or Gupta year 207 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;526). In this grant Dhruvasena is described as the third son of the Sen&#225;pati or general Bha&#7789;&#225;rka. Of Sen&#225;pati Bha&#7789;&#225;rka neither copperplate nor inscription has been found. Certain coins which General Cunningham <abbr expan="Arch&#230;ological Survey Report">Arch. Surv. Rept.</abbr> IX. Pl.

 </p><p>Of the king the great Kshatri, great devotee of the sun, the illustrious &#346;arvva-bha&#7789;&#7789;&#225;raka.</p></q>

 </p><p>This &#346;arvva seems to have been a <corr sic="R&#225;shtrak&#250;&#7789;a">R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a</corr> or Gurjjara king. His coins were continued so long in use and were so often copied that in the end upright strokes took the place of letters. That these coins did not belong to the founder of the Valabhi dynasty appears not only from the difference of name between Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#225;raka and Bha&#7789;&#225;rka but because the coiner was a king and the founder of the Valabhis a general.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Sen&#225;pati Bha&#7789;&#225;rka, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;509&#8211;520&#160;?</note>Of the kingdom which Sen&#225;pati Bha&#7789;&#225;rka overthrew the following details are given in one of his epithets in Valabhi copperplates: &#8216;Who obtained glory by dealing hundreds of blows on the large and very mighty armies of the Maitrakas, who by <note place="margin">The Maitrakas, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;470&#8211;509.</note>force had subdued their enemies.&#8217; As regards these Maitrakas it is to be noted that the name Maitraka means Solar. The sound of the compound epithet <hi>Maitraka-amitra</hi> that is Maitraka-enemy used in the inscription makes it probable that the usual form Mihira or solar was rejected in favour of Maitraka which also means solar to secure the necessary assonance with <hi>amitra</hi> or enemy. The form Mihira solar seems a Hinduizing or meaning-making of the northern tribal name Me&#7693;h or Mehr, the Mehrs being a tribe which at one time seem to have held sway over the whole of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a and which are still found in strength near the Barda hills in the south-west of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a.<note id="n87.1" n="1">The Mehrs seem to have remained in power also in north-east K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a till the thirteenth century. Mokher&#225;ji Gohil the famous chief of Piram was the son of a daughter of Dhan Mehr or Mair of Dhanduka, R&#225;s M&#225;la, I. 316.</note> The Jethv&#225; chiefs of Porbandar who were formerly powerful rulers are almost certainly of the Mehr tribe. They are still called Mehr kings and the Mehrs of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a regard them as their leaders and at the call of their Head are ready to fight for him. The chief of Mehr traditions describes the fights of their founder Makaradhvaja with one May&#250;radhvaja. This tradition seems to embody the memory of an historical struggle. The <hi>makara</hi> or fish is the tribal badge of the Mehrs and is marked on a Morb&#237; copperplate dated <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;904 (G. 585) and on the forged Dh&#237;n&#237;ki grant of the Mehr king J&#225;&#237;k&#225;deva. On the other hand May&#250;radhvaja or peacock-bannered would be the name of the Guptas beginning with Chandragupta who ruled in Gujar&#225;t (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;396&#8211;416) and whose coins have a peacock on the reverse. The tradition would thus be a recollection of the struggle between the Mehrs and Guptas in which about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;470 the Guptas were defeated. The Mehrs seem to have been a northern tribe, who, the evidence of place names seems to show, passed south through Western <corr sic="R&#225;jputana">R&#225;jput&#225;na</corr>, Jaslo, Ajo, Bad, and Koml leaders of this tribe giving their names to the settlements of Jesalmir, Ajmir, Badmer, and Komalmer. The resemblance of name and the nearness of dates suggest a connection between the Mehrs and the great Panj&#225;b conqueror of the Guptas Mihirakula (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;512&#8211;540&#160;?).

 </p><p>The above account of the founder of the Valabhis accepts the received opinion that he was the Sen&#225;pati or General of the Guptas. The two chief points in support of this view are that the Valabhis adopted both the Gupta era and the Gupta currency. Still it is to be noted that this adoption of a previous era and currency by no means implies any connection with the former rulers.<note id="n88.1" n="1">All the silver and copper coins found in Valabhi and in the neighbouring town of Sihor are poor imitations of Kum&#225;ragupta&#8217;s (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;417&#8211;453) and of Skandagupta&#8217;s (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;454&#8211;470) coins, smaller lighter and of bad almost rude workmanship. The only traces of an independent currency are two copper coins of Dharasena, apparently Dharasena IV., the most powerful of the dynasty who was called <hi>Chakravartin</hi> or Emperor. The question of the Gupta-Valabhi coins is discussed in <abbr expan="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">Jour. Royal As. Socy.</abbr> for Jan. 1893 pages 133&#8211;143. Dr. B&#252;hler (page 138) holds the view put forward in this note of Dr. Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l&#8217;s namely that the coins are Valabhi copies of Gupta currency. Mr. Smith (Ditto, 142&#8211;143) thinks they should be considered the coins of the kings whose names they bear.</note> Both the Gurjjaras (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;580) and the Ch&#225;lukyas (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;642) adopted the existing era of the Traik&#250;&#7789;akas (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;248&#8211;9) while as regards currency the practice of continuing the existing type is by no means uncommon.<note id="n88.2" n="2">The three types of coins still current at Ujjain, Bhilsa, and Gw&#225;lior in the territories of His Highness Sindhia are imitations of the previous local Muhammadan coinage.</note> In these circumstances, and seeing that certain of the earlier Valabhi inscriptions refer to an overlord who can hardly have been a Gupta, the identification of the king to whom the original Sen&#225;pati owed allegiance must be admitted to be doubtful.

 </p><p>All known copperplates down to those of Dharasena (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;579 the great grandson of Bha&#7789;&#225;rka) give a complete genealogy from Bha&#7789;&#225;rka to Dharasena. Later copperplates omit all mention of any descendants but those in the main line.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Sen&#225;pati&#8217;s Sons.</note>Sen&#225;pati Bha&#7789;&#225;rka had four sons, (1) Dharasena (2) Dro&#7751;asim&#803;ha (3) Dhruvasena and (4) Dharapa&#7789;&#7789;a. Of Dharasena the first son no record has been traced. His name first appears in the copperplates of his brother Dhruvasena where like his father he is called Sen&#225;pati. Similarly of the second son Dro&#7751;asim&#803;ha no record exists except in the copperplates of his brother Dhruvasena. In these copperplates unlike his father and elder brother Dhruvasena is called <hi>Mah&#225;r&#225;ja</hi> and is mentioned as &#8216;invested with royal authority in person by the great lord, the lord of the wide extent of the whole world.&#8217; This great lord or <hi>paramasv&#225;mi</hi> could not have been his father Bha&#7789;&#225;rka.

It is not clear where Dro&#7751;asim&#803;ha was installed king probably it was in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a from the south-east of which his father and elder brother had driven back the Mehrs or Maitrakas.<note id="n88.3" n="3">As the date of Dro&#7751;asim&#803;ha&#8217;s investiture is about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;520 it is necessary to consider what kings at this period claimed the title of supreme lord and could boast of ruling the whole earth. The rulers of this period whom we know of are Mihirakula, <pb/>Ya&#347;odharman Vish&#7751;uvardhana, the descendants of Kum&#225;ragupta&#8217;s son Puragupta, and the Gupta chiefs of Eastern M&#225;lwa. Neither Toram&#225;&#7751;a nor Mihirakula appears to have borne the paramount title of Parame&#347;vara though the former is called Mah&#225;r&#225;j&#225;dhir&#225;ja in the Era&#7751; inscription and Avanipati or Lord of the Earth (= simply king) on his coins: in the Gw&#225;lior inscription Mihirakula is simply called Lord of the Earth. He was a powerful prince but he could hardly claim to be ruler of &#8220;the whole circumference of the earth.&#8221; He therefore cannot be the installer of Dro&#7751;asim&#803;ha. Taking next the Guptas of Magadha we find on the Bhit&#225;ri seal the title of Mah&#225;r&#225;j&#225;dhir&#225;ja given to each of them, but there is considerable reason to believe that their power had long since shrunk to Magadha and Eastern M&#225;lwa, and if Hiuen Tsiang&#8217;s B&#225;l&#225;ditya is Narasim&#803;hagupta, he must have been about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;520 a feudatory of Mihirakula, and could not be spoken of as supreme lord, nor as ruler of the whole earth. The Guptas of M&#225;lwa have even less claim to these titles, as Bh&#225;nugupta was a mere Mah&#225;r&#225;ja, and all that is known of him is that he won a battle at Era&#7751; in Eastern M&#225;lwa in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;510&#8211;11. Last of all comes <corr sic="Vishnuvardhana">Vish&#7751;uvardhana</corr> or Ya&#347;odharman of Mandasor. In one of the Mandasor inscriptions he has the titles of R&#225;j&#225;dhir&#225;ja and Parame&#347;vara (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;532&#8211;33); in another he boasts of having carried his conquests from the Lauhitya (Brahmaputra) to the western ocean and from the Him&#225;laya to mount Mahendra. It seems obvious that Ya&#347;odharman is the Paramasv&#225;mi of the Valabhi plate, and that the reference to the western ocean relates to Bha&#7789;&#225;rka&#8217;s successes against the Maitrakas.&#8212;(A.M.T.J.)</note>

It is not clear whether Dhruvasena succeeded his brother Dro&#7751;asim&#803;ha or was a separate contemporary ruler. The absence of &#8216;falling at the feet of&#8217; or other successional phrase and the use of the epithet &#8216;serving at the feet of&#8217; the great lord seem to show that his power was distinct from his brothers. In any case Dhruvasena is the first of the family who has a clear connection with Valabhi from which the grants of <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;526 and 529 are dated.

 </p><p>In these grants Dhruvasena&#8217;s father Bha&#7789;&#225;rka and his elder brothers are described as &#8216;great M&#225;he&#347;varas&#8217; that is followers of &#346;iva, while Dhruvasena himself is called <hi>Paramabh&#225;gavata</hi> the great Vaish&#7751;ava. It is worthy of note, as stated in the <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;535 grant, that his niece Du&#7693;&#7693;&#225; (or Lul&#225;?) was a Buddhist and had dedicated a Buddhist monastery at Valabhi. The latest known date of Dhruvasena is <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;535 (G. 216). Whether Dharapa&#7789;&#7789;a or Dharapa&#7789;&#7789;a&#8217;s son Guhasena succeeded is doubtful. That Dharapa&#7789;&#7789;a is styled Mah&#225;r&#225;ja and that a twenty-four years&#8217; gap occurs between the latest grant of Dhruvasena and <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;559 the earliest grant of <pb id="pb90" n="90"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter VIII.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Valabhis, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;509&#8211;766.</hi></item><item>Dhruvasena I. <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;526&#8211;535.</item></list> </fw>Guhasena favour the succession of Dharapa&#7789;&#7789;a.

Guhasena is a Sanskrit name meaning Whose army is like that of K&#225;rttika-sv&#225;mi: his popular name was probably Guhila. It appears probable that the Gohil and Gehlot <corr sic="Rajput">R&#225;jput</corr> chiefs of <corr sic="K&#225;thi&#225;va&#7693;a">K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a</corr> and R&#225;jput&#225;na, who are believed to be descendants of the Valabhis, take their name from Guhasena or Guha, the form Gehloti or Gehlot, <hi>Guhila-utta</hi>, being a corruption of Guhilaputra or descendants of Guhila, a name which occurs in old <corr sic="R&#225;jp&#250;t">R&#225;jput</corr> records.<note id="n90.4" n="4">Kum&#225;r&#225;p&#225;la-Charita, Abu Inscriptions.</note> This lends support to the view that Guhasena was believed to be the first king of the dynasty. Like his predecessors he is called Mah&#225;r&#225;ja or great king. In one grant he is called the great &#346;aiva and in another the great Buddhist devotee (<hi>paramop&#225;saka</hi>), while he grants villages to the Buddhist monastery of his paternal aunt&#8217;s daughter Du&#7693;&#7693;&#225;. Though a &#346;aivite Guhasena, like most of his predecessors, tolerated and even encouraged Buddhism. His minister of peace and war is named Skandabha&#7789;a.

 </p><p>The beginning of Guhasena&#8217;s reign is uncertain. Probably it was not earlier than <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;539 (G. 220). His latest known date is <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;567 (G. 248) but he may have reigned two years longer.

 </p><p>The &#346;atru&#241;jaya M&#225;h&#225;tmya has a prophetic account of one &#346;&#237;l&#225;ditya who will be a propagator of religion in Vikrama Sam&#803;vat <pb id="pb91" n="91"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter VIII.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Valabhis, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;509&#8211;766.</hi></item><item>&#346;&#237;l&#225;ditya I. <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;590&#8211;609.</item></list> </fw>477 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;420). This M&#225;h&#225;tmya is comparatively modern and is not worthy of much trust. Vikrama Sam&#803;vat 477 would be <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;420 when no Valabhi kingdom was established and no &#346;&#237;l&#225;ditya can have flourished. If the date 477 has been rightly preserved, and it be taken in the &#346;aka era it would correspond with Gupta 237 or <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;556, that is thirty to forty years before &#346;&#237;l&#225;ditya&#8217;s reign. Although no reliance can be placed on the date still his second name Dharm&#225;ditya gives support to his identification with the &#346;&#237;l&#225;ditya of the M&#225;h&#225;tmya.

 </p><p>His grants like many of his predecessors style &#346;&#237;l&#225;ditya a great devotee of &#346;iva. Still that two of his three known grants were made to Buddhist monks shows that he tolerated and respected Buddhism. The writer of one of the grants is mentioned as the minister of peace and war Chandrabha&#7789;&#7789;i; the D&#250;taka or causer of the gift in two of the Buddhist grants is Bha&#7789;&#7789;a &#193;dityaya&#347;as apparently some military officer. The third grant, to a temple of &#346;iva, has for its D&#250;taka the illustrious Kharagraha apparently the brother and successor of the king.

 </p><p>&#346;&#237;l&#225;ditya&#8217;s reign probably began about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;594 (G. 275). His latest grant is dated <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;609 (G. 290).<note id="n91.1" n="1"><abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> XI. 306.</note>

Tod identifies the barbarian destroyers of Valabhi either with the descendants of the second century Parthians, or with the White Huns Getes or K&#225;this, or with a mixture of these who in the beginning of the sixth century supplanted the Parthians (<abbr expan="Annals of R&#225;jasth&#225;n">An. of R&#225;j.</abbr> I. 83 and 217&#8211;220; Western India, 214, 352). Elliot (History, I. 408) accepting Tod&#8217;s date <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;524 refers the overthrow to Skythian barbarians from Sindh. Elphinstone, also accepting <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;524 as an approximate date, suggested (History, 3rd Edition, 212) as the destroyer the Sassanian Naushirv&#225;n or Chosroes the Great (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;531&#8211;579) citing in support of a Sassanian inroad Malcolm&#8217;s Persia, I. 141 and Pottinger&#8217;s Travels, 386. Forbes (R&#225;s M&#225;l&#225;, I. 22) notes that the Jain accounts give the date of the overthrow Vik. Sam&#803;. 375 that is <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;319 apparently in confusion with the epoch of the Gupta era which the Valabhi kings adopted.<note id="n94.a" n="A">Similarly <abbr>S.</abbr> 205 the date given by some of Col. Tod&#8217;s authorities (<abbr expan="Annals of R&#225;jasth&#225;n">An. of R&#225;j.</abbr> I. 82 and 217&#8211;220) represents <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;524 the practical establishment of the Valabhi dynasty. The mistake of ascribing an era to the overthrow not to the founding of a state occurs (compare Sachau&#8217;s Alberuni, II. 6) in the case both of the Vikrama era <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;57 and of the &#346;&#225;liv&#225;hana era <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;78. In both these cases the error was intentional. It was devised with the aim of hiding the supremacy of foreigners in early Hindu history. So also, according to Alberuni&#8217;s information (Sachau, II. 7) the Guptak&#225;la <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;319 marks the ceasing not the beginning of the wicked and powerful Guptas. This device is not confined to India. His Mede informant told Herodotus (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;450 Rawlinson&#8217;s Herodotus, I. 407) that <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;708 was the founding of the Median monarchy. The date really marked the overthrow of the Medes by the Assyrian Sargon.</note> Forbes says (Ditto, 24): If the destroyers had not been called <hi>mlechchhas</hi> I might have supposed them to be the Dakhan Ch&#225;lukyas. Genl. Cunningham (<abbr>Anc. Geog.</abbr> 318) holds that the date of the destruction was <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;658 and the destroyer the R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a R&#225;ja Govind who restored the ancient family of <corr sic="S&#225;ur&#225;sh&#7789;ra">Saur&#225;sh&#7789;ra</corr>. Thomas (Prinsep&#8217;s Useful Tables, 158) fixes the destruction of Valabhi at <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;745 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 802). In the K&#225;thi&#225;w&#225;r Gazetteer Col. Watson in one passage (page 671) says the destroyers may have been the early Muhammadans who retired as quickly as they came. In another passage (page 274), accepting Mr. Burgess&#8217; (<abbr expan="Arch&#230;ological Survey Report">Arch. Sur. Rep.</abbr> IV. 75) Gupta era of <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;195 and an overthrow date of <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;642, and citing a Wadhw&#225;n couplet telling how Ebhal Valabhi withstood the Iranians, Col. Watson suggests the destroyers may have been Iranians. If the P&#225;rsis came in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;642 they must have come not as raiders but as refugees. If they could they would not have destroyed Valabhi. If the P&#225;rsis destroyed Valabhi where next did they flee to.</note> The only explanation in agreement with the copperplate evidence that a &#346;&#237;l&#225;ditya was ruling at Valabhi as late as <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;766 (Val.

It is the story that Bappa, who according to Mew&#225;&#7693; tradition is the founder of Gehlot power at Chitor, abandoned his country for Ir&#225;n in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;764 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 820). It seems probable that this Bappa or Saila is not the founder of Gehlot power at Chitor, but, according to the Valabhi use of Bappa, is the founder&#8217;s father and that this retreat to Ir&#225;n refers to his being carried captive to Mans&#250;ra on the fall either of Valabhi or of Gandh&#225;r.</note> is the Hindu account preserved by Alberuni (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1030)<note id="n94.3" n="3">Reinaud&#8217;s Fragments, 143 note 1; <foreign lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M&#233;moire Sur l&#8217;Inde</foreign>, 105; Sachau&#8217;s Alberuni, I. 193. The treachery of the magician Ranka is the same cause as that assigned by Forbes (R&#225;s M&#225;l&#225;, I. 12&#8211;18) from Jain sources. The local legend (Ditto, 18) points the inevitable Tower of Siloam moral, a moral which (compare R&#225;s M&#225;l&#225;, I. 18) is probably at the root of the antique tale of Lot and the Cities of the Plain, that men whose city was so completely destroyed must have been sinners beyond others. Dr. Nicholson (<abbr expan="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> Ser. I. Vol. XIII. page 153) in 1851 thought the site of Valabhi bore many traces of destruction by water.</note> that soon after the Sindh capital Mans&#250;ra was founded, say <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;750&#8211;770, Ranka a disaffected subject of the era-making Valabhi, with presents of money persuaded the Arab lord of Mans&#250;ra to send a naval expedition against the king of Valabhi. In a night attack king Valabha was killed and his people and town were destroyed. Alberuni adds: Men say that still in our time such traces are left in <pb id="pb95" n="95"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter VIII.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Valabhis, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;509&#8211;766.</hi></item><item>The Fall of Valabhi, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;750&#8211;770.</item></list> </fw>that country as are found in places wasted by an unexpected attack.<note id="n95.1" n="1">Lassen (Ind. Alt. III. 533) puts aside Alberuni&#8217;s Arab expedition from Mans&#250;ra as without historical support and inadmissible. Lassen held that Valabhi flourished long after its alleged destruction from Mans&#250;ra. Lassen&#8217;s statement (see Ind. Alt. III. 533) is based on the mistaken idea that as the Valabhis were the Balharas the Balharas&#8217; capital M&#225;nkir must be Valabhi. So far as is known, except Alberuni himself (see below) none of the Arab geographers of the ninth<corr>,</corr> tenth or eleventh centuries mentions Valabhi. It is true that according to Lassen (Ind. Alt. 536) Masudi <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;915, Istakhri <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;951, and Ibn H&#225;ukal <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;976 all attest the existence of Valabhi up to their own time. This remark is due either to the mistake regarding Malkhet or to the identification of B&#225;lwi or Balzi in Sindh (Elliot&#8217;s History, I. 27&#8211;34) with Valabhi. The only known Musalm&#225;n reference to Valabhi later than <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;750 is Alberuni&#8217;s statement (Sachau, II. 7) that the Valabhi of the era is 30 <hi>yojanas</hi> or 200 miles south of <corr sic="Anahilav&#225;&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a</corr>. That after its overthrow Valabhi remained, as it still continues, a local town has been shown in the text. Such an after-life is in no way inconsistent with its destruction as a leading capital in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;767.</note> For this expedition against Valabhi Alberuni gives no date. But as Mans&#250;ra was not founded till <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;750<note id="n95.2" n="2">According to Alberuni (Sachau, I. 21) Al Mans&#250;ra, which was close to Br&#225;hman&#225;b&#225;d about 47 miles north-east of Haidar&#225;b&#225;d (Elliot&#8217;s Musalm&#225;n Historians, I. 372&#8211;374) was built by the great Muhammad K&#225;sim about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;713. Apparently Alberuni wrote Muhammad K&#225;sim by mistake for his grandson Amru Muhammad (Elliot, I. 372 note 1 and 442&#8211;3), who built the city a little before <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;750. Reinaud (Fragments, 210) makes Amru the son of Muhammad K&#225;sim. Masudi (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;915) gives the same date (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;750), but (Elliot, I. 24) makes the builder the Ummayide governor Mans&#250;r bin Jamhur. Idr&#237;si (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1137 Elliot, I. 78) says Mans&#250;ra was built and named in honour of the Khalif Abu J&#225;far-al-Mansur. If so its building would be later than <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;754. On such a point Idr&#237;si&#8217;s authority carries little weight.</note> and as the latest Valabhi copperplate is <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;766 the expedition must have taken place between <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;750 and 770. In support of the Hindu tradition of an expedition from Mans&#250;ra against Valabhi between <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;750 and 770 it is to be noted that the Arab historians of Sindh record that in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;758 (H. 140) the Khalif Mans&#250;r sent Amru bin Jamal with a fleet of barks to the coast of Barada.<note id="n95.3" n="3">Elliot, I. 244.</note> Twenty years later <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;776 (H. 160) a second expedition succeeded in taking the town, but, as sickness broke out, they had to return. The question remains should the word, which in these extracts Elliot reads Barada, be read Balaba. The lax rules of Arab cursive writing would cause little difficulty in adopting the reading Balaba.<note id="n95.4" n="4">That the word read Barada by Elliot is in the lax pointless <hi>shikasta</hi> writing is shown by the different proposed readings (Elliot, I. 444 note 1) N&#225;rand, Barand, and Barid. So far as the original goes Balaba is probably as likely a rendering as Barada. Reinaud (Fragments, 212) says he cannot restore the name.</note> Further it is hard to believe that Valabhi, though to some extent sheltered by its distance from the coast and probably a place of less importance than its chroniclers describe, should be unknown to the Arab raiders of the seventh and eighth centuries and after its fall be known to Alberuni in the eleventh century. At the same time, as during the eighth century there was, or at least as there may have been,<note id="n95.5" n="5">Though, except as applied to the Porbandar range of hills, the name Barada is almost unknown, and though Ghumli not Barada was the early (eighth-twelfth century) capital of Porbandar some place named Barada seems to have existed on the Porbandar coast. As early as the second century <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>, Ptolemy (McCrindle, 37) has a town Barda-xema on the coast west of the village <hi>Kome</hi> (probably the road or <hi>kom</hi>) of <corr sic="Saur&#225;shtra">Saur&#225;sh&#7789;ra</corr>; and St. Martin (<foreign lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Geographie Grecque et Latine de l&#8217;Inde</foreign>, 203) identifies Pliny&#8217;s (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;77) Varetat&#230; next the Odomber&#230; or people of Kachh with the Varadas according to Hemachandra (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1150) a class of foreigners or <hi>mlechchhas</hi>. A somewhat tempting identification of Barada is with Beruni&#8217;s B&#225;rwi (Sachau, I. 208) or Baraoua (Reinaud&#8217;s Fragments, 121) 84 miles (14 <hi>parasangs</hi>) west of Soman&#225;tha.

The identification is doubtful. Tod (Annals, I. 217) names the fort Gajni or Gayni and there was a fort Gajni close to Cambay. Elliot (I. 445) would identify the Arab Kandah&#225;r with Khandad&#225;r in north-west K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a.

 </p><p>Even after <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;770 Valabhi seems to have been attacked by the Arabs. Dr. Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l notices that two Jain dates for the destruction of the city 826 and 886 are in the Vira era and that this means not the Mah&#225;vira era of <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;526 but the Vikram era of <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;57. The corresponding dates are therefore <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;769 and 829. Evidence in support of the <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;769 and 770 defeat is given in the text. On behalf of Dr. Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l&#8217;s second date <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;829 it is remarkable that in or about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;830 (Elliot, I. 447) M&#250;sa the Arab governor of Sindh captured B&#225;la the ruler of As Sharqi. As there seems no reason to identify this As Sharqi with the Sindh lake of As Sharqi mentioned in a raid in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;750 (Elliot, I. 441: <abbr expan="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> (1893) page 76) the phrase would mean B&#225;la king of the east. The Arab record of the defeat of B&#225;la would thus be in close agreement with the Jain date for the latest foreign attack on Valabhi.</p></note>

The text shows that Pandit Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l was of opinion the Valabhis were Gurjjaras. The text also notes that the Pandit believed they reached south-east K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a by sea from near Broach and that if they did not come to Broach from M&#225;lwa at least the early rulers obtained (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;520 and 526) investiture from the M&#225;lwa kings. Apart from the doubtful evidence of an early second to fifth century B&#225;la or Valabhi three considerations weigh against the theory that the Valabhis entered Gujar&#225;t from M&#225;lwa in the sixth century. First their acceptance of the Gupta era and of the Gupta currency raises the presumption that the Valabhis were in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a during Gupta ascendancy (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;440&#8211;480): Second that the Sesodias trace their pedigree through Valabhi to an earlier settlement at Dh&#225;nk in south-west K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a and that the V&#225;las of Dh&#225;nk still hold the place of heads of the V&#225;las of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a: And Third that both Sesodias and V&#225;las trace their origin to Kanaksen a second century North Indian immigrant into K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a combine to raise the presumption that the V&#225;las were in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a before the historical founding of Valabhi in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;526<note id="n97.4" n="4">Tod <abbr expan="Annals of R&#225;jasth&#225;n">An. of Raj.</abbr> I. 112 and Western India, 148: R&#225;s M&#225;l&#225;, I. 21.

Such a withdrawal from the coast, the result of the terror of Arab raids, is in agreement with the fact that from about the middle of the eighth century the rulers of Gujar&#225;t established an inland capital at <corr sic="Anahilav&#225;&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a</corr> (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;746).<note id="n98.1" n="1">Tod&#8217;s Western India, 51.</note> It is further in agreement with the establishment by the Gohil refugees of a town Balli in Mew&#225;&#7693;; with the continuance as late as <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;968 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1024) by the Sesodia chief of the Valabhi title &#346;&#237;l&#225;ditya or Sail<note id="n98.2" n="2">Tod&#8217;s <abbr expan="Annals of R&#225;jasth&#225;n">An. of Raj.</abbr> I. 230.</note>; and with the peculiar Valabhi blend of Sun and &#346;iva worship still to be found in Udepur.<note id="n98.3" n="3">The cherished title of the later Valabhis, &#346;&#237;l&#225;ditya Sun of Virtue, confirms the special sun worship at Valabhi, which the mention of Dharapa&#7789;&#7789;a (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;550) as a devotee of the supreme sun supports, and which the legends of Valabhi&#8217;s sun-horse and sun-fountain keep fresh (R&#225;s M&#225;l&#225;, I. 14&#8211;18). So the great one-stone lin&#775;gas, the most notable trace of Valabhi city (<abbr expan="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J. R. A. S.</abbr> Ser. I. Vol. XIII. 149 and XVII. 271), bear out the Valabhi copperplate claim that its rulers were great worshippers of &#346;iva. Similarly the R&#225;na of Udepur, while enjoying the title of Sun of the Hindus, prospering under the sun banner, and specially worshipping the sun (Tod&#8217;s Annals, I. 565) is at the same time the Minister of &#346;iva the One Lin&#775;g <hi>Eklingakadiw&#225;n</hi> (Ditto 222, R&#225;j. Gaz. III. 53). The blend is natural. The fierce noon-tide sun is Mah&#225;k&#225;la the Destroyer. Like &#346;iva the Sun is lord of the Moon. And marshalled by Soman&#225;tha the great Soul Home the souls of the dead pass heavenwards along the rays of the setting sun. [Compare Sachau&#8217;s Alberuni, II. 168.] It is the common sun element in &#346;aivism and in Vaishnavism that gives their holiness to the sunset shrines of Soman&#225;tha and Dw&#225;rka. For (Ditto, 169) the setting sun is the door whence men march forth into the world of existence Westwards, heavenwards.</note> The question remains how far can the half-poetic accounts of the Sesodias be reconciled with a date for the fall of Valabhi so late as <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;766. The mythical wanderings, the caveborn Guha, and his rule at Idar can be easily spared. The name Gehlot which the Sesodias trace to the caveborn Guha may as the Bh&#225;vnagar Gehlots hold have its origin in Guhasena (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;559&#8211;567) perhaps the first Valabhi chief of more than local distinction.<note id="n98.4" n="4">This explanation is hardly satisfactory. The name Gehlot seems to be Guhila-putra from Gobhila-putra an ancient Br&#225;hman gotra, one of the not uncommon cases of R&#225;jputs with a Br&#225;hman gotra. The R&#225;jput use of a Br&#225;hman gotra is generally considered a technical affiliation, a mark of respect for some Br&#225;hman teacher. It seems doubtful whether the practice is not a reminiscence of an ancestral Br&#225;hman strain.

The close connection of the V&#225;las with the earlier waves of K&#225;this is admitted.<note id="n99.9" n="9">The V&#225;la connection with the K&#225;this complicates their history. Col. Watson (K&#225;th. Gaz. 130) seems to favour the view that the V&#225;las were the earliest wave of K&#225;this who came into K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a from M&#225;lwa apparently with the Guptas (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;450) (Ditto, 671). Col. Watson seems to have been led to this conclusion in consequence of the existence <pb/>of the petty state of K&#225;tti in west Kh&#225;ndesh. But the people of the K&#225;tti state in west Kh&#225;ndesh are Bhils or Kolis. Neither the people nor the position of the country seems to show connection with the K&#225;this of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a. Col. Watson (K&#225;th. Gaz. 130) inclines to hold that the V&#225;las are an example of the rising of a lower class to be R&#225;jputs. That both V&#225;las and K&#225;this are northerners admitted into Hinduism may be accepted. Still it seems probable that on arrival in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a the V&#225;las were the leaders of the K&#225;this and that it is mainly since the fall of Valabhi that a large branch of the V&#225;las have sunk to be K&#225;this. The K&#225;thi traditions admit the superiority of the V&#225;las. According to Tod (Western India, 270: Annals, I. 112&#8211;113) the K&#225;this claim to be a branch or descendants of the V&#225;las. In K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a the V&#225;las, the highest division of K&#225;this (R&#225;s M&#225;l&#225;, I. 296; K&#225;th. Gaz. 122, 123, 131, 139), admit that their founder was a V&#225;la R&#225;jput who lost caste by marrying a K&#225;thi woman. Another tradition (R&#225;s M&#225;l&#225;, I. 296; K&#225;th. Gaz. 122 note 1) records that the K&#225;this flying from Sindh took refuge with the V&#225;las and became their followers. Col. Watson (K&#225;th. Gaz. 130) considers the practice in Porbandar and <corr sic="Navanagar">Nav&#225;nagar</corr> of styling any lady of the Dh&#225;nk V&#225;la family who marries into their house K&#225;thi&#225;n&#237;b&#225;i the K&#225;thi lady proves that the V&#225;las are K&#225;this. But as this name must be used with respect it may be a trace that the V&#225;las claim to be lords of the K&#225;this as the Jetwas claim to be lords of the Mers. That the position of the V&#225;las and K&#225;this as R&#225;jputs is doubtful in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a and is assured (Tod&#8217;s Annals, I. 111) in R&#225;jput&#225;na is strange. The explanation may perhaps be that aloofness from Muhammadans is the practical test of honour among <corr sic="R&#225;jputana">R&#225;jput&#225;na</corr> Hindus, and that in the troubled times between the thirteenth and the seventeenth centuries, like the Jh&#225;l&#225;s, the V&#225;las and K&#225;this may have refused Moghal alliances, and so won the approval of the R&#225;n&#225;s of Mew&#225;&#7693;.</note> Considering that the present <pb id="pb100" n="100"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter VIII.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Valabhis, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;509&#8211;766.</hi></item><item>The V&#225;las of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a.</item></list> </fw>(1881) total of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a V&#225;la R&#225;jputs is about 900 against about 9000 V&#225;la K&#225;this, the V&#225;las,<note id="n100.1" n="1">K&#225;th.

 </p><p><note place="margin">The V&#225;las and K&#225;this.</note>If from the first and not solely since the fall of Valabhi the V&#225;las have been associated with the K&#225;this it seems best to suppose they held to the K&#225;this a position like that of the Jetwas to their followers the Mers. According to Tod<note id="n100.2" n="2">Western India, 207; Annals, I. 112&#8211;113.</note> both V&#225;las and K&#225;this claim the title <hi>Tata Mult&#225;nka Rai</hi> Lords of Tata and Mult&#225;n. The accounts of the different sackings of Valabhi are too confused and the traces of an earlier settlement too scanty and doubtful to justify any attempt to carry back Valabhi and the V&#225;las beyond the Maitraka overthrow of Gupta power in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;470&#8211;480). The boast that Bha&#7789;&#225;rka, the reputed founder of the house of Valabhi (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;509), had obtained glory by dealing hundreds of blows on the large and very mighty armies of the Maitrakas who by force had subdued their enemies, together with the fact that the Valabhis did and the Maitrakas did not adopt the Gupta era and currency seem to show the V&#225;las were settled in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a at an earlier date than the Mers and Jetwas. That is, if the identification is correct, the V&#225;las and K&#225;this were in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a before the first wave of the White Huns approached. It has been noticed above under Skandagupta that the enemies, or some of the enemies, with whom, in the early years of his reign <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;452&#8211;454, Skandagupta had so fierce a struggle were still in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;456 a source of anxiety and required the control of a specially able viceroy at Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h. Since no trace of the K&#225;this appears in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a legends or traditions before the fifth century the suggestion may be offered that under V&#225;la or B&#225;la leadership the K&#225;this were among the enemies who on the death of Kum&#225;ragupta (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;454) seized the Gupta possessions in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a.

A connection between Kanishka and the race of the Sun would be made easy by the intentional confusing of the names Kshatrapa and Kshatriya and by the fact that during part at least of his life fire and the sun were Kanishka&#8217;s favourite deities.</note>

St. Martin (<foreign lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr>Geog.</abbr> Greque et Latine de l&#8217;Inde</foreign>, 149) takes B&#225;hika to be a contraction of B&#225;hlika. Reasons are given below for considering the Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata form B&#225;hika a confusion with the earlier tribes of that name rather than a contraction of B&#225;hlika or B&#225;lhika. The form B&#225;hika was also favoured by the writer in the Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata because it fitted with his punning derivation from their two fiend ancestors <hi>Vahi</hi> and <hi>Hika</hi>. St. Martin, 408.</note> The name B&#225;lhika might belong to more than one of the Central Asian invaders of Northern India during the centuries before and after Christ, whose manner of life might be expected to strike an &#193;ry&#225;varta Br&#225;hman with horror. The date of the settlement of these northern tribes (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;180&#8211;<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;300) does not conflict with the comparatively modern date (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;150&#8211;250) now generally received for the final revision of the Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata.<note id="n103.4" n="4">St. Martin <foreign lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr>Geog.</abbr> Greque et Latine de l&#8217;Inde</foreign>, 403, puts the probable date at <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;380 or about fifty years before Alexander. St. Martin held that the passage belonged to the final revision of the poem. Since St. Martin&#8217;s time the tendency has been to lower the date of the final revision by at least 500 years. The fact noted by St. Martin (Ditto, page 404) that Jartika which the Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata writer gives as another name for B&#225;hika is a Sanskritised form of Jat further supports the later date. It is now generally accepted that the Jats are one of the leading tribes who about the beginning of the Christian era passed from Central Asia into India.</note> This explanation does not remove the difficulty caused by references to B&#225;hikas and B&#225;lhikas<note id="n103.5" n="5"><p>The name Valabhi, as we learn from the Jain historians, is a Sanskritised form of Valahi, which can be easily traced back to one of the many forms (B&#225;lh&#237;ka, B&#225;lhika, Balhika, Bahl&#237;ka, B&#225;hlika, V&#225;hl&#237;ka, Vahl&#237;ka, V&#225;lh&#237;ka, V&#225;lhika, Valhika) of a tribal name which is of common occurrence in the Epics. This name is, no doubt rightly, traced back to the city of Balkh, and originally denoted merely the people of Baktria. There is, however, evidence that the name also denoted a tribe doubtless of Baktrian origin, but settled in India: the Emperor Chandra speaks of defeating the V&#225;hlikas after crossing the seven mouths of the Indus: Var&#225;ha-Mihira speaks of the V&#225;lhikas along with the people who dwell on Sindhu&#8217;s banks (B&#7771;. Sam&#803;. V. 80): and, most decisive of all, the K&#225;&#347;ik&#225; V&#7771;itti on P&#225;&#7751;. VIII. iv. 9 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;650) gives Bahl&#237;ka as the name of the people of the Sauv&#237;ra country, which, as Alberuni tells us, corresponded to the <pb/>modern Mult&#225;n, the very country to which the traditions of the modern V&#225;las point.

 </p><p>If the usual derivation of the name B&#225;lhika be accepted,<note id="n103.5.a" n="A">There is a very close parallel in the modern Panj&#225;b, where (see Census Report of 1881) the national name Baluch has become a tribal name in the same way as B&#225;lhika.</note> it is possible to go a step further and fix a probable limit before which the tribe did not enter India. The name of Balkh in the sixth century <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi> was, as we learn from Darius&#8217; inscriptions, B&#225;khtri, and the Greeks also knew it as Baktra: the Avesta form is Bakhdhi, which according to the laws of sound-change established by Prof. Darmsteter for the Arachosian language as represented by the modern Pushtu, would become Bahli (see <foreign lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chants Populaires des Afghans</foreign>, Introd. page xxvii). This reduction of the hard aspirates to spirants seems to have taken place about the first century <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>: parallel cases are the change from Parthava to Palhava, and Mithra to Mihira. It would seem therefore that the Bahlikas did not enter India before the first century <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>: and if we may identify their subduer Chandra with Chandragupta I., we should have the fourth century <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi> as a lower limit for dating their invasion.

 </p><p>Unfortunately, however, these limits cannot at present be regarded as more than plausible: for the name Balhika or Valhika appears to occur in works that can hardly be as modern as the first century <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi> The Atharvaveda-pari&#347;ishtas might be put aside, as they show strong traces of Greek influence and are therefore of late date: and the supposed occurrences in P&#225;&#7751;ini belong to the commentators and to the Ga&#7751;ap&#225;&#7789;ha only and are of more or less uncertain age. But the name occurs, in the form Balhika, in one hymn of the Atharvaveda itself (Book V. 22) which there is no reason to suppose is of late date.

 </p><p>The lower limit is also uncertain as the identification of Chandra of the inscription with the Gupta king is purely conjectural.&#8212;(A. M. T. J.)</p></note> in P&#225;&#7751;ini and other writers earlier than the first of the after-Alexander Skythian invasions. At the same time as shown in the footnote there seems reason to hold that the change from the B&#225;khtri of Darius (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;510) and Alexander the Great (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;330) to the modern Balkh did not take place before the first century after Christ. If this view is correct it follows that <pb id="pb104" n="104"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter VIII.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Valabhis, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;509&#8211;766.</hi></item><item>V&#225;las.</item></list> </fw>if the form Bahlika occurs in P&#225;&#7751;ini or other earlier writers it is a mistaken form due to some copyist&#8217;s confusion with the later name Bahlika. As used by P&#225;&#7751;ini the name B&#225;hika applied to certain Panj&#225;b tribes seems a general term meaning Outsider a view which is supported by Brian Hodgson&#8217;s identification of the Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata B&#225;hikas with the Bahings one of the outcaste or broken tribes of Nep&#225;l.<note id="n104.1" n="1">Hodgson&#8217;s Essays on Indian Subjects, I. 405 Note.</note> The use of B&#225;hika in the Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata would then be due either to the wish to identify new tribes with old or to the temptation to use a word which had a suitable meaning in Sanskrit. If then there is fair ground for holding that the correct form of the name in the Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata is B&#225;lhika and that B&#225;lhika means men of Balkh the question remains which of the different waves of Central Asian invaders in the centuries before and after Christ are most likely to have adopted or to have received the title of Baktrians. Between the second century before and the third century after Christ two sets of northerners might justly have claimed or have received the title of Baktrians. These northerners are the Baktrian Greeks about <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;180 and the Yuechi between <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;20 and <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;300. Yavana is so favourite a name among Indian writers that it may be accepted that whatever other northern tribes the name Yavana includes no name but Yavana passed into use for the Baktrian Greeks. Their long peaceful and civilised rule (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;130&#8211;<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;300&#160;?) from their capital at Balkh entitles the Yuechi to the name Baktrians or B&#225;hlikas. That the Yuechi were known in India as Baktrians is proved by the writer of the Periplus (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;247), who, when Baktria was still under Yuechi rule, speaks of the Baktrianoi as a most warlike race governed by their own sovereign.<note id="n104.2" n="2">McCrindle&#8217;s Periplus, 121. Compare Rawlinson&#8217;s Seventh Monarchy, 79. The absence of Indian reference to the Yuechi supports the view that in India the Yuechi were known by some other name.</note> It is known that in certain cases the Yuechi tribal names were of local origin. Kush&#225;n the name of the leading tribe is according to some authorities a place-name.<note id="n104.3" n="3">According to Reinaud (<foreign lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M&#233;moire Sur l&#8217;Inde</foreign>, 82 note 3) probably the modern <pb/>Kochanya or Kashania sixty or seventy miles west of Samarkand. This is Hiuen Tsiang&#8217;s (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;620) Ki&#8217;uh-shwangi-ni-kia or Kush&#225;nika.

It is therefore in agreement both with the movements and with the practice of the Yuechi, that, on reaching India, a portion of them should be known as B&#225;hlikas or B&#225;lhikas. Though the evidence falls short of proof there seems fair reason to suggest that the present <corr sic="Rajput">R&#225;jput</corr> and K&#225;thi V&#225;las or B&#225;las of Gujar&#225;t and <corr sic="Rajput&#225;na">R&#225;jput&#225;na</corr>, through a Sanskritised V&#225;hlika, may be traced to some section of the Yuechi, who, as they passed south from Baktria, between the first century before and the fourth century after Christ, assumed or received the title of men of Balkh.

 </p><p>One collateral point seems to deserve notice. St. Martin<note id="n105.1" n="1">Etude sur la Geographie Grecque et Latine de l&#8217;Inde, 147.</note> says: &#8216;The Greek historians do not show the least trace of the name B&#225;hlika.&#8217; Accepting B&#225;hika, with the general sense of Outsider, as the form used by Indian writers before the Christian era and remembering<note id="n105.2" n="2">McCrindle&#8217;s Alexander in India, 350.</note> P&#225;&#7751;ini&#8217;s description of the M&#225;lavas and Kshudrakas as two B&#225;hika tribes of the North-West the fact that P&#225;&#7751;ini lived very shortly before or after the time of Alexander and was specially acquainted with the Panj&#225;b leaves little doubt that when (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;326) Alexander conquered their country the Malloi and Oxydrakai, that is the M&#225;lavas and Kshudrakas, were known as B&#225;hikas. Seeing that Alexander&#8217;s writers were specially interested in and acquainted with the Malloi and Oxydrakai it is strange if St. Martin is correct in stating that Greek writings show no trace of the name B&#225;hika. In explanation of this difficulty the following suggestion may be offered.<note id="n105.3" n="3">The suggestion is made by Mr. A. M. T. Jackson.</note> As the Greeks sounded their <hi>kh</hi> (<choice><orig><foreign lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#967;</foreign></orig><reg type="trans"><foreign lang="grc-latn" xml:lang="grc-latn">ch</foreign></reg></choice>) as a spirant, the Indian B&#225;hika would strike them as almost the exact equivalent of their own word <choice><orig><foreign lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#946;&#945;&#954;&#967;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962;</foreign></orig><reg type="trans"><foreign lang="grc-latn" xml:lang="grc-latn">bakchikos</foreign></reg></choice>. More than one of Alexander&#8217;s writers has curious references to a Bacchic element in the Panj&#225;b tribes. Arrian<note id="n105.4" n="4">McCrindle&#8217;s Alexander, 136.</note> notices that, as Alexander&#8217;s fleet passed down the Jhelum, the people lined the banks chanting songs taught them by Dionysus and the Bacchantes. According to Quintus Curtius<note id="n105.5" n="5">McCrindle&#8217;s Alexander, 252.</note> the name of Father Bacchus was famous among the people to the south of the Malloi. These references are vague. But Strabo is definite.<note id="n105.6" n="6">Compare Strabo, XV. I. 8. The Oxydrakai are the descendants of Dionysus. Again, XV. I. 24: The Malloi and the Oxydrakai who as we have already said are fabled to be related to Dionysus.</note> The Malloi and Oxydrakai are reported to be the descendants of Bacchus. This passage is the more important since Strabo&#8217;s use of the writings of Aristobulus Alexander&#8217;s historian and of Onesikritos Alexander&#8217;s pilot and Br&#225;hman-interviewer gives his details a special value.<note id="n105.7" n="7">See McCrindle&#8217;s Alexander, 157, 369, 378, 398. Compare St. Martin <foreign lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr>Geog.</abbr> Grecque et Latine de l&#8217;Inde</foreign>, 102.</note> It may be said Strabo explains why the Malloi and Oxydrakai were called Bacchic and Strabo&#8217;s explanation is not in agreement with the proposed B&#225;hika origin. The answer is that Strabo&#8217;s explanation can be proved to be in part, if not altogether, fictitious. Strabo<note id="n105.8" n="8">Strabo, XV. I. 8 and 24, Hamilton&#8217;s Translation, III. 76, 95.</note> gives two reasons why the Oxydrakai <pb id="pb106" n="106"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter VIII.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Valabhis, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;509&#8211;766.</hi></item><item>V&#225;las.</item></list> </fw>were called Bacchic. First because the vine grew among them and second because their kings marched forth <hi>Bakkhik&#244;s</hi> that is after the Bacchic manner. It is difficult to prove that in the time of Alexander the vine did not grow in the Panj&#225;b. Still the fact that the vines of Nysa near Jal&#225;l&#225;b&#225;d and of the hill Meros are mentioned by several writers and that no vines are referred to in the Greek accounts of the Panj&#225;b suggests that the vine theory is an after-thought.<note id="n106.1" n="1">References to the vines of Nysa and Meros occur in Strabo, Pliny, Quintus Curtius, Philostratus, and Justin: McCrindle&#8217;s Alexander in India, 193 note 1, 321, and 339. Strabo (Hamilton&#8217;s Translation, III. 86) refers to a vine in the country of Musikanus or Upper Sindh. At the same time (Ditto, 108) Strabo accepts <corr sic="Megasthenes&#8217;">Megasthen&#234;s&#8217;</corr> statement that in India the wild vine grows only in the hills.</note> Strabo&#8217;s second explanation, the Bacchic pomp of their kings, can be more completely disproved. The evidence that neither the Malloi nor the Oxydrakai had a king is abundant.<note id="n106.2" n="2">The Kathaioi Malloi and Oxydrakai are (Arrian in McCrindle&#8217;s Alexander, 115, 137, 140, 149) called independent in the sense of kingless: they (Ditto, 154) sent leading men not ambassadors: (compare also Diodorus Siculus and Plutarch, Ditto 287, 311): the Malloi had to chose a leader (Q. Curtius, Ditto 236).</note> That the Greeks knew the Malloi and Oxydrakai were called Bakkhikoi and that they did not know why they had received that name favours the view that the explanation lies in the Indian name B&#225;hika. One point remains. Does any trace of the original B&#225;hikas or Outsiders survive? In Cutch K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a and North Gujar&#225;t are two tribes of half settled cattle-breeders and shepherds whose names Rahb&#225;ris as if Rah&#225;baher and Bharv&#225;ds as if Baherv&#225;da seem like B&#225;hika to mean Outsider. Though in other respects both classes appear to have adopted ordinary Hindu practices the conduct of the Bharv&#225;d women of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a during their special marriage seasons bears a curiously close resemblance to certain of the details in the Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata account of the B&#225;hika women. Colonel Barton writes:<note id="n106.3" n="3">K&#225;thi&#225;w&#225;r Gazetteer, 138.</note> &#8216;The great marriage festival of the K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a Bharv&#225;ds which is held once in ten or twelve years is called the Milkdrinking, <hi>Dudhp&#237;no</hi>, from the lavish use of milk or clarified butter.

From the nature of the case the new era of the Gujar&#225;t Ch&#225;lukyas may be accepted as of Gujar&#225;t origin. Grants remain of Jayasim&#803;havarmman&#8217;s sons dated &#346;. 421, 443, and 490.<note id="n107.4" n="4"><abbr>J. B. B. R. A.

Of the two Gujar&#225;t eras, the Gupta-Valabhi (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;319) and the Traik&#250;&#7789;aka (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;248&#8211;9), the Gupta-Valabhi is clearly unsuitable. On the other hand the result is so closely in accord with <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;248&#8211;9, the Traik&#250;&#7789;aka epoch, as to place the correctness of the identification almost beyond question.

 </p><p>Jayasim&#803;havarmman must have established his power in South Gujar&#225;t before <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;669&#8211;70 (T. 421), as in that year his son &#346;ry&#225;&#347;raya made a grant as heir apparent. Another plate of &#346;ry&#225;&#347;raya found in Surat shows that in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;691&#8211;2 (T. 443) Jayasim&#803;havarmman was still ruling with &#346;ry&#225;&#347;raya as heir apparent. In view of these facts the establishment of Jayasim&#803;havarmman&#8217;s power in Gujar&#225;t must be taken at about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;666. The copperplates of his sons and grandson do not say whom Jayasim&#803;havarmman overthrew. Probably the defeated rulers were Gurjjaras, as about this time a Gurjjara dynasty held the Broach district with its capital at N&#225;nd&#237;pur&#237; the modern N&#225;ndod in the R&#225;jpipla State about thirty-five miles east of Broach.

It is possible that the power of the earlier Gurjjara kings spread as far south as Bals&#225;r and even up to Konkan limits. It was apparently from them that, during the reign of his brother Vikram&#225;ditya, Jayasim&#803;havarmman took South Gujar&#225;t, driving the Gurjjaras north of the T&#225;pti and eventually confining them to the Broach district, the Gurjjaras either acknowledging Ch&#225;lukya sovereignty or withstanding the Ch&#225;lukyas and retaining their small territory in the Broach district by the help of the Valabhis with whom they were in alliance.<note id="n108.3" n="3"><abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> XIII. 70.</note> In either case the Ch&#225;lukya power seems to have hemmed in the Broach Gurjjaras, as Jayasim&#803;havarmman had a son Buddhavarmman ruling in Kaira. A copperplate of Buddhavarmman&#8217;s son Vijayar&#225;ja found in Kaira is granted from Vijayapura identified with Bij&#225;pur near <corr sic="P&#225;rantij">Par&#225;ntij</corr>, but probably some place further south, as the grant is made to Br&#225;hmans of Jambusar.

Jayasim&#803;havarmman&#8217;s eldest son was &#346;ry&#225;&#347;raya &#346;&#237;l&#225;ditya who made his Navs&#225;r&#237; grant in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;669&#8211;70 (T. 421); the village granted being said to be in the Navas&#225;rik&#225; Vishaya. &#346;ry&#225;&#347;raya&#8217;s other plate dated <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;691&#8211;2 (T. 443) grants a field in the village of Osumbhal&#225; in the K&#225;rmaneya &#193;h&#225;ra that is the district of K&#225;mlej on the T&#225;pti fifteen miles north-east of Surat. In both grants &#346;&#237;l&#225;ditya is called Yuvar&#225;ja, which shows that his father ruled with him from <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;669 to <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;691. Both copperplates show that these kings treated as their overlords the main dynasty of the southern Ch&#225;lukyas as respectful mention is made in the first plate of Vikram&#225;ditya Saty&#225;&#347;raya and in the second of his son Vinay&#225;ditya Saty&#225;&#347;raya. Apparently &#346;ry&#225;&#347;raya died before his father as the two late grants of Bals&#225;r and Khe&#7693;&#225; give him no place in the list of rulers.

Professor Bhandarkar considers the plate a forgery, but there seems no sufficient reason for doubting its genuineness. No fault can be found with the character. It is written in the usual style of Western Ch&#225;lukya grants, and contains the names of a number of Br&#225;hman grantees with minute details of the fields granted a feature most unusual in a forged grant. In the Gupta era, which equally with the Traik&#250;&#7789;aka era may be denoted by the word <hi><abbr>Sam&#803;.</abbr></hi> and which is more likely to be in use in North Gujar&#225;t the 394 would represent the fairly probable <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;713.

 </p><p><note place="margin">N&#225;gavarddhana.</note>Jayasim&#803;ha appears to have had a third son N&#225;gavarddhana ruling in West N&#225;sik which was connected with South Gujar&#225;t through Bals&#225;r, P&#225;rdi, and Penth.

Dr. Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l, who believed in its genuineness, supposes it to be dated in the Gupta era (<hi rend="sc">G.</hi> 394 = <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;714) and infers from it the existence of Ch&#225;lukya rule far to the north of Broach. But the most cursory comparison of it with the Khe&#7693;&#225; grants of Dadda II. (see <abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> XIII. 81ff) which are dated (admittedly in the [so-called] Traik&#250;&#7789;aka era) 380 and 385 respectively, shows that a large number of Dadda&#8217;s grantees reappear in the Ch&#225;lukya grant. The date of the Ch&#225;lukya plate must therefore be interpreted as a Traik&#250;&#7789;aka or Chedi date.

 </p><p><note place="margin"><hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;610&#8211;640.</note>This being so, it is clearly impossible to suppose that Vijayar&#225;ja&#8217;s grandfather Jayasim&#803;ha is that younger son of Pulake&#347;i II. (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;610&#8211;640) who founded the Gujar&#225;t branch family. It has been usually supposed that the Jayasim&#803;ha of our grant was a younger brother of Pulake&#347;i II.: but this also is chronologically impossible: for Jayasim&#803;ha can hardly have been more than ten years of age in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;597&#8211;98, when his elder brother was set aside as too young to rule. His son Buddhavarmman could hardly have been born before <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;610, so that Buddhavarmman&#8217;s son Vijayar&#225;ja must have made his grant at the age of twelve at latest. The true solution of the question seems to be that given by Dr. Bhand&#225;rkar in his Early History of the Deccan (page 42 note 7), namely that the grant is a forgery. To the reasons advanced by him may be added the fact pointed out by Mr. Fleet (<abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> VII. 251) that the grant is a palimpsest, the engraver having originally commenced it &#8220;Svasti Vijayavikshep&#225;n Na.&#8221; It can hardly be doubted that <hi>Na</hi> is the first syllable of N&#225;nd&#237;pur&#237; the palace of the Gurjjara kings. Many of the grantees were Br&#225;hmans of Jambusar and subjects of Dadda II. of Broach, whose grants to them are extant. It seems obvious that Vijayar&#225;ja&#8217;s grant was forged in the interest of these persons by some one who had Gurjjara grants before him as models, but knew very little of the forms used in the chancery of the Ch&#225;lukyas.

 </p><p>Setting aside this grant, the first genuine trace of Ch&#225;lukya rule in Gujar&#225;t is to be found in the grant of the Sendraka chief Nikumbhalla&#347;akti, which bears date Sam&#803;. 406 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;654&#8211;5) and relates to the gift to a Br&#225;hman of the village of Balisa (Wanesa) in the Treya&#7751;&#7751;a (Ten) district. Dr. B&#252;hler has shown (<abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> XVIII. page 265ff) that the Sendrakas were a K&#225;narese family, and that Nikumbhalla&#347;akti must have come to Gujar&#225;t as a Ch&#225;lukya feudatory, though he names no overlord. He was doubtless subordinate to the Ch&#225;lukya governor of N&#225;sik.

 </p><p>The next grant that requires notice is that of N&#225;gavarddhana, who describes himself distinctly as the son of Pulake&#347;i&#8217;s brother Jayasim&#803;ha, though Dr. Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l believed this Jayasim&#803;ha to be Pulake&#347;i&#8217;s son. Mr. Fleet points out other difficulties connected with this grant, but on the whole decides in favour of its genuineness (see <abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> IX. 123). The description of Pulake&#347;i II. in this grant refers to his victory over Harshavarddhana, but also describes him as having conquered the three kingdoms of Chera, Chola, and P&#225;&#7751;&#7693;ya by means of his horse of the Chitraka&#7751;&#7789;ha breed, and as meditating on the feet of &#346;ri N&#225;gavarddhana. Now all of these epithets, except the reference to Harshavarddhana, belong properly, not to Pulake&#347;i II. but to his son Vikram&#225;ditya I. The conquest of the confederacy of Cholas, Cheras (or Keral&#803;as), and P&#225;&#7751;&#7693;yas is ascribed to Vikram&#225;ditya in the inscriptions of his son Vinay&#225;ditya (Fleet in <abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> X. 134): the Chitraka&#7751;&#7789;ha horse is named in Vikram&#225;ditya&#8217;s own grants (<abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> VI. 75 &amp;c.) while his meditation upon the feet of N&#225;gavarddhana recurs in the T. 421 grant of &#346;ry&#225;&#347;raya &#346;&#237;l&#225;ditya (<abbr>B. B. R. A. S.</abbr> XVI. 1ff). This confusion of epithets between Pulake&#347;i II. and Vikram&#225;ditya makes it difficult to doubt that N&#225;gavarddhana&#8217;s grant was composed either during or after Vikram&#225;ditya&#8217;s reign, and under the influence of that king&#8217;s grants. It may be argued that even in that case the grant may be genuine, its inconsistencies being due merely to carelessness. This supposition the following considerations seem <corr sic="to">too</corr> negative. Pulake&#347;i II. was alive at the time of Hiuen Tsiang&#8217;s visit (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;640), but is not likely to have reigned very much longer. And, as Vikram&#225;ditya&#8217;s reign is supposed to have begun about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;669&#8211;70, a gap remains of nearly thirty years. That part of this period was occupied by the war with the three kings <pb id="pb112" n="112"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter IX.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Ch&#225;lukyas, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;634&#8211;740.</hi></item></list> </fw>of the south we know from Vikram&#225;ditya&#8217;s own grants: but the grant of &#346;ry&#225;&#347;raya &#346;&#237;l&#225;ditya referred to above seems to show that Vikram&#225;ditya was the successor, not of his father, but of N&#225;gavarddhana upon whose feet he is described as meditating. It follows that N&#225;gavarddhana succeeded Pulake&#347;i and preceded Vikram&#225;ditya on the imperial throne of the Ch&#225;lukyas whereas his grant could not have been composed until the reign of Vikram&#225;ditya.

 </p><p>Although the grant is not genuine, we have no reason to doubt that it gives a correct genealogy, and that N&#225;gavarddhana was the son of Pulake&#347;i&#8217;s brother Jayasim&#803;ha and therefore the first cousin of Vikram&#225;ditya. The grant is in the regular Ch&#225;lukya style, and the writer, living near the Northern Ch&#225;lukya capital, N&#225;sik, had better models than the composer of Vijayar&#225;ja&#8217;s grant. Both grants may have been composed about the time when the Ch&#225;lukya power succumbed to the attacks of the R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;743).&#8212;(A. M. T.

It is hard to say to what suzerain these Broach Gurjjaras acknowledged fealty. Latterly they seem to have accepted the Ch&#225;lukyas on the south as their overlords.

 </p><p>Their copperplates and seals closely resemble the plates and seals of the Gujar&#225;t Ch&#225;lukyas. The characters of all but the forged grants are like those of Gujar&#225;t Ch&#225;lukya grants and belong to the Gujar&#225;t variety of the Southern India style. At the same time it is to be noted that the royal signature at the end of the plates is of the northern type, proving that the Gurjjaras were originally northerners. The language of most of the grants is Sanskrit prose as in Valabhi plates in a style curiously like the style of the contemporary author B&#225;&#7751;a in his great works the K&#225;dambar&#237; and Harshacharita. From this it may be inferred that B&#225;&#7751;a&#8217;s style was not peculiar to himself but was the style in general use in India at that time.

 </p><p>A still nearer approximation to the date of the Gurjjara conquest is suggested by the change in the titles of Dharasena I. of Valabhi, who <pb id="pb115" n="115"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter X.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Gurjjaras, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;580&#8211;808.</hi></item></list> </fw>in his grants of Sam&#803;vat 252<note id="n115.1" n="1"><abbr>Ind.

It seems highly probable that this power was that of the Gurjjaras of Bh&#237;nm&#225;l; and that their successes therefore took place between <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;580 and 588 or about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;585.

 </p><p>Dadda II.&#8217;s own grants describe him as having attained the five great titles, and praise him in general terms: and both he and his brother Ra&#7751;agraha sign their grants as devout worshippers of the sun.

(which took place before <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;634). The protection given to the Valabhi king is perhaps referred to in the Khe&#7693;&#225; grants in the mention of &#8220;strangers and suppliants and people in distress.&#8221; If this is the case the defeat of Valabhi took place before <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;628&#8211;29, the date of the earlier of the Khe&#7693;&#225; grants. On the other hand, the phrase quoted is by no means decisive, and the fact that in Hiuen Tsiang&#8217;s time Dhruvasena of Valabhi was son-in-law of Harsha&#8217;s son, makes it unlikely that Harsha should have been at war with him. It follows that the expedition referred to may have taken place in the reign of Dharasena IV. who may have been the son of Dhruvasena by another wife than Harsha&#8217;s granddaughter.

 </p><p>To Dadda II.&#8217;s reign belongs Hiuen Tsiang&#8217;s notice of the kingdom of Broach (<hi rend="sc">C.</hi> 640 <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>).<note id="n116.1" n="1">Beal&#8217;s Buddhist Records, II. 259.</note> He says &#8220;all their profit is from the sea&#8221; and describes the country as salt and barren, which is still true of large tracts in the west and twelve hundred years ago was probably the condition of a much larger area than at present. Hiuen Tsiang does not say that Broach was subject to any other kingdom, but it is clear from the fact that Dadda bore the five great titles that he was a mere feudatory. At this period the valuable port of Broach, from which all their profit was made, was a prize fought for by all the neighbouring powers. With the surrounding country of L&#225;&#7789;a, Broach submitted to Pulake&#347;i II. (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;610&#8211;640):<note id="n116.2" n="2"><abbr>Ind.

 </p><p>Dr. Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l&#8217;s (<abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> XIII. 70) chief grounds for holding that the Umet&#225; and Il&#225;o grants (the Bagumr&#225; grant was unknown to him) were forgeries were:

 <list type="simple"><item>(1) Their close resemblance in pal&#230;ography to one another and to the forged grant of Dharasena II. of Valabhi dated &#346;aka 400;     </item><item>(2) That though they purport to belong to the fifth century they bear the same writer&#8217;s name as the Khe&#7693;&#225; grants of the seventh century. </item></list>

 </p><p>Further Mr. Fleet (<abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> XIII. 116) pointed out:

 <list type="simple"><item>(3) That the description of Dadda I. in the Il&#225;o and Umet&#225; grants agrees almost literally with that of Dadda II. in the Khe&#7693;&#225; grants, and that where it differs the Khe&#7693;&#225; grants have the better readings. </item></list>

 </p><p>To these arguments Dr. B&#252;hler has replied (<abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> XVII. 183):

 <list type="simple"><item>(1) That though there is a resemblance between these grants and that of Dharasena II., still it does not prove more than that the forger of Dharasena&#8217;s grant had one of the other grants before him;     </item><item>(2) That, as the father&#8217;s name of the writer is not given in the Khe&#7693;&#225; grants, it cannot be assumed that he was the same person as the writer of the Il&#225;o and Umet&#225; grants; and <pb id="pb118" n="118"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter X.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Gurjjaras, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;580&#8211;808.</hi></item></list> </fw></item><item>(3) That genuine grants sometimes show that a description written for one king is afterwards applied to another, and that good or bad readings are no test of the age of a grant. </item></list>

 </p><p>It may be admitted that Dr. B&#252;hler has made it probable that the suspected grants and the grant of Dharasena were not all written by the same hand, and also that the coincidence in the writer&#8217;s name is not of much importance in itself. But the pal&#230;ographical resemblance between Dharasena&#8217;s grant on the one hand and the doubtful Gurjjara grants on the other is so close that they must have been written at about the same time. As to the third point, the verbal agreement between the doubtful grants on the one hand and the Khe&#7693;&#225; grants on the other implies the existence of a continuous tradition in the record office of the dynasty from the end of the fifth till near the middle of the seventh century. But the San&#775;khe&#7693;&#225; grant of Nirihullaka (<abbr>Ep. Ind.</abbr> II. 21) shows that towards the end of the sixth century the lower Narbad&#225; valley was occupied by jungle tribes who acknowledged the supremacy of the Kalachuris. Is it reasonable to suppose that after the first Gurjjara line was thus displaced, the restorers of the dynasty should have had any memory of the forms in which the first line drew up their grants? At any rate, if they had, they would also have retained their original seal, which, as the analogy of the Valabhi plates teaches us, would bear the founder&#8217;s name. But we find that the seal of the Khe&#7693;&#225; plates bears the name &#8220;S&#225;manta Dadda,&#8221; who can be no other than the &#8220;S&#225;manta Dadda&#8221; who ruled from <hi rend="sc">C.</hi> 585&#8211;605 <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi> It follows that the Gurjjaras of the seventh century themselves traced back their history in Broach no further than <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;585. Again, it has been pointed out in the text that a passage in the description of Dadda II. (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;620&#8211;650) in the Khe&#7693;&#225; grants seems to refer to his protection of the Valabhi king, so that the description must have been written for <hi>him</hi> and not for the fifth century Dadda as Dr. B&#252;hler&#8217;s theory requires.

 </p><p>These points coupled with Mr. Fleet&#8217;s proof (<abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> XVIII. 91) that the &#346;aka dates do not work out correctly, may perhaps be enough to show that none of these three grants can be relied upon as genuine.&#8212;(A. M. T. J.)</p></q>

The connection includes three periods: A first of sixty-five years from &#346;aka 665 to 730 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;743&#8211;808) when the Gujar&#225;t ruler was dependent on the main Dakhan R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a: a second of eighty years between &#346;aka 730 and 810 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;808&#8211;888) when the Gujar&#225;t family was on the whole independent: and a third of eighty-six years &#346;aka 810 to 896 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;888&#8211;974) when the Dakhan R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as again exercised direct sway over Gujar&#225;t.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Their Origin.</note>Information regarding the origin of the R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as is imperfect. That the Gujar&#225;t R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as came from the Dakhan in &#346;aka 665 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;743) is known. It is not known who the Dakhan R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as originally were or where or when they rose to prominence. R&#225;tho&#7693; the dynastic name of certain Kanauj and M&#225;rw&#225;r <corr sic="Rajputs">R&#225;jputs</corr> represents a later form of the word R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a. Again certain of the later inscriptions call the R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as Ra&#7789;&#7789;as a word which, so far as form goes, is hardly a correct Prakrit contraction of R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a. The Sanskritisation of tribal names is not exact. If the name Ra&#7789;&#7789;a was strange it might be pronounced Ratta, Ratha, or Raddi. This last form almost coincides with the modern K&#225;narese caste name Reddi, which, so far as information goes, would place the R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as among the tribes of pre-Sanskrit southern origin.

The combination R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a would then mean the chiefs or leaders as opposed to the rank and file of the Ra&#7789;&#7789;as. The bardic accounts of the origin of the R&#225;tho&#7693;s of Kanauj and <corr sic="Marw&#225;r">M&#225;rw&#225;r</corr> vary greatly.

 </p><p>The grant is dated from M&#225;napura, perhaps M&#225;n&#225;n&#775;ka&#8217;s city, probably an older form of M&#225;nyakhe&#7789;a the modern M&#225;lkhed the capital of the later R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as about sixty miles south-east of Shol&#225;pur.

The date is almost contemporary with the year of Dantidurga in the S&#225;mangad plate (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;753). As Dantidurga was a very powerful monarch we may identify the first Kakka of this plate with Kakka I. the grandfather of Dantidurga and thus trace from Dhruva Kakka&#8217;s son a branch of feudatory R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as ruling in M&#225;lwa or Gujar&#225;t, whose leaders were Dhruva, his son Govinda, and Govinda&#8217;s son Kakka II.

Dantidurga died childless and was succeeded by his uncle K&#7771;ish&#7751;a. Of this K&#7771;ish&#7751;a the Baroda grant says that he assumed the government for the good of the family after having rooted out a member of the family who had taken to mischief-making. It seems probable that Kakka II. the grantor of the &#193;ntroli plate is the mischief-maker and that his mischief was, on the death of Dantidurga, the attempt to secure the succession to himself. K&#7771;ish&#7751;a frustrated Kakka&#8217;s attempt and rooted him out so effectively that no trace of Kakka&#8217;s family again appears.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Dhruva I. <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;795.</note>Dhruva was a mighty monarch whose conquests spread from South India as far north as Allah&#225;b&#225;d. During Dhruva&#8217;s lifetime his son Govinda probably ruled at May&#250;rakhandi or Morkhanda in the N&#225;sik district and held the Gh&#225;t country and the Gujar&#225;t coast from Bals&#225;r northwards. Though according to a Kapadvanj grant Govinda had several brothers the R&#225;dhanpur (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;808) and Van-Dindori (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;808) grants of his son Govinda III. state that his father, seeing Govinda&#8217;s supernatural K&#7771;ish&#7751;a-like powers, offered him the sovereignty of the whole world. Govinda declined, saying, The Ka&#7751;&#7789;hik&#225; or coast tract already given to me is enough. Seeing that May&#250;rakhandi or Morkhanda in N&#225;sik was Govinda&#8217;s capital, this <corr sic="Kan&#7789;hik&#225;">Ka&#7751;&#7789;hik&#225;</corr> appears to be the coast from Bals&#225;r northwards.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Govinda III. <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;800&#8211;808.</note>According to Gujar&#225;t Govinda&#8217;s (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;827&#8211;833) K&#225;v&#237; grant (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;827), finding his power threatened by Stambha and other kings, Dhruva made the great Govinda independent during his own lifetime. This suggests that while Dhruva continued to hold the main <corr sic="Rash&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a">R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a</corr> sovereignty in the Dakhan, he probably invested Govinda with the sovereignty of Gujar&#225;t. This fact the K&#225;v&#237; grant (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;827) being a Gujar&#225;t grant would rightly mention while it would not find a place in the R&#225;dhanpur (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;808) and Van-Dindori (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;808) grants of the main R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as. Of the kings who opposed Govinda the chief was Stambha who may have some connection with Cambay, as, during the time of the <corr sic="Anahilav&#225;&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a</corr> kings, Cambay came to be called Stambha-t&#237;rtha instead of by its old name of Gambh&#250;t&#225;. According to the grants the allied chiefs were no match for Govinda. The Gurjjara fled through fear, not returning even in dreams, and the M&#225;lava king submitted. Who the Gurjjara was it is hard to say. He may have belonged to some Gurjjara dynasty that rose to importance after Dantidurga&#8217;s conquest or the name may mean a ruler of the Gurjjara country. In either case some North Gujar&#225;t ruler is meant whose conquest opened the route from Broach to M&#225;lwa. From M&#225;lwa Govinda marched to the Vindhyas where the king apparently of East M&#225;lwa named M&#225;r&#225; &#346;arva submitted to Govinda paying tribute. From the Vindhyas Govinda returned to Gujar&#225;t passing the rains at &#346;r&#237;bhavana,<note id="n123.2" n="2"><abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> VI. 65.</note> apparently Sarbhon in the &#193;mod t&#225;luka of Broach, a favourite locality which he had ruled during his father&#8217;s lifetime. After the rains Govinda went south as far as the Tungabhadra. On starting for the south Govinda handed Gujar&#225;t to his brother Indra with whom begins the Gujar&#225;t branch of the R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as. Several plates distinctly mention that Indra was given the kingdom of the lord of L&#225;&#7789;a by (his brother) Govinda. Other Gujar&#225;t grants, apparently with intent to show that Indra won Gujar&#225;t and did not receive it in gift, after mentioning &#346;arvva Amoghavarsha as the successor of Govinda (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;818), state that the king (apparently of Gujar&#225;t) was &#346;arvva&#8217;s uncle Indra.

 </p><p>Karka&#8217;s Baroda plates (&#346;. 734, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;812) record the grant of Baroda itself called Va&#7693;apadraka in the text. Baroda is easily identified by the mention of the surrounding villages of Jambuv&#225;vik&#225; the modern J&#225;mbuv&#225;da on the east, of Ankottaka the modern &#193;kot&#225; on the west, and of Vaggh&#225;chchha perhaps the modern V&#225;ghodia on the north. The writer of the grant is mentioned as the great minister of peace and war Nem&#225;ditya son of Durgabha&#7789;&#7789;a, and the D&#250;taka or grantor is said to be R&#225;japutra that is prince Dantivarmman apparently a son of Karka. The grantee is a Br&#225;hman originally of Valabhi.

 </p><p>Karka&#8217;s Navs&#225;r&#237; grant (&#346;. 738, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;816) is made from Khe&#7693;&#225; and records the gift of the village of Sam&#237;padraka in the country lying between the Mah&#237; and the Narbad&#225;. The grantee is a South Indian Br&#225;hman from B&#225;d&#225;mi in Bij&#225;pur, a man of learning popularly known as Pa&#7751;&#7693;ita Vallabhar&#225;ja because he was proficient in the fourteen Vidy&#225;s. The D&#250;taka of this grant is a South Indian <hi>bha&#7789;a</hi> or military officer named the illustrious Dro&#7751;amma.

 </p><p>Karka&#8217;s Surat grant (&#346;. 743, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;821) is made from the royal camp on the bank of the Vankik&#225; apparently the V&#225;nki creek near Bals&#225;r. It records the grant of a field in Amb&#225;p&#225;taka village near N&#225;gas&#225;rika (Navs&#225;r&#237;) to a Jain temple at N&#225;garik&#225;, (Navs&#225;r&#237;). The writer of the grant is the minister of war and peace N&#225;r&#225;yana son of Durgabha&#7789;&#7789;a. As this is the first grant by a Gujar&#225;t R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a of lands south of the T&#225;pti it may be inferred that in return for his support Amoghavarsha added to Karka&#8217;s territory the portion of the North Konkan which now forms Gujar&#225;t south of the T&#225;pti.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Dantivarmman, Heir Apparent.</note>According to Karka&#8217;s Baroda plate (&#346;. 734, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;812) Karka had a son named Dantivarmman who is mentioned as the princely D&#250;taka of the plate. The fact of being a D&#250;taka implies that Dantivarmman was then of age. That Dantivarmman was a son of Karka is supported by Ak&#225;lavarsha&#8217;s Bagumr&#225; plate (&#346;. 810, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;888), where, though the plate is badly composed and the grammar is faulty, certain useful details are given regarding Dantivarmman who is clearly mentioned as the son of Karka. Karka had another son named Dhruva, who, according to three copperplates, succeeded to the throne. But as Dantivarmman&#8217;s son&#8217;s grant is dated &#346;aka 810 or seventy-six years later than the Baroda plate some error seems to have crept into the genealogy of the plate. Neither Dantivarmman nor Dhruva seems to have succeeded their father as according to Govinda&#8217;s K&#225;v&#237; grant (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;827) their uncle Govinda succeeded his brother Karka. The explanation may be that Dantivarmman died during his father&#8217;s lifetime, and that some years later, after a great yearning for a son,<note id="n125.1" n="1">Several copperplates give Karka the epithet <hi>Putr&#237;yatastasya</hi> Son-yearning.</note> probably in Karka&#8217;s old age, a second <pb id="pb126" n="126"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter XI.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;743&#8211;974.</hi></item><item>Dantivarmman, Heir Apparent.</item></list> </fw>son Dhruva was born, during whose minority, after Karka&#8217;s death, Govinda appears to have temporarily occupied the throne.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Govinda, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;827&#8211;833.</note>This Govinda, the brother and successor of Karka, was also called Prabh&#250;tavarsha. One plate of Govinda&#8217;s K&#225;v&#237; grant is dated &#346;aka 749 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;827). It gives no details regarding Govinda. The grant is made from Broach and records the gift of a village<note id="n126.1" n="1">All village and boundary details have been identified by Dr. B&#252;hler. <abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> V. 148.</note> to a temple of the Sun called Jay&#225;ditya in Kotipur near K&#225;pik&#225; that is K&#225;v&#237; thirty miles north of Broach. The writer of the grant is Yoge&#347;vara son of Avalokita and the D&#250;taka or grantor was one Bha&#7789;&#7789;a Kumuda. As it contains no reference to Govinda&#8217;s succession the plate favours the view that Govinda remained in power only during the minority of his nephew Dhruva.

Dhruva seems to have abandoned his father&#8217;s position of loyal feudatory to the main R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as. According to a copperplate dated &#346;aka 832 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;910) Vallabha that is Amoghavarsha, also called the illustrious great Skanda, sent an army and besieged and burned the Ka&#7751;&#7789;hik&#225; that is the coast tract between Bombay and Cambay. In the course of this campaign, according to Dhruva II.&#8217;s Bagumr&#225; grant (<abbr>S.</abbr> 789, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;867),<note id="n126.4" n="4"><abbr>Ind.

In all these troubles the Bagumr&#225; grant notes that Dhruva was aided by a younger brother named Govindar&#225;ja.

The Dakhan K&#7771;ish&#7751;a seems to have triumphed over his Gujar&#225;t namesake as henceforward South Gujar&#225;t or L&#225;&#7789;a was permanently included in the territory of the Dakhan R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as.<note id="n129.1" n="1">It will be noted that in &#346;aka 836 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;914) K&#7771;ish&#7751;a&#8217;s grandson Indra re-grants 400 resumed villages many of which were perhaps resumed at this time by K&#7771;ish&#7751;a.</note>

 </p><p>At this time (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;910) a grant from Kapadvanj dated &#346;. 832 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;910) and published in <abbr>Ep. Ind.</abbr> I. 52ff. states that a <hi>mah&#225;s&#225;manta</hi> or noble of K&#7771;ish&#7751;a Ak&#225;lavarsha&#8217;s named Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a, with his <hi>da&#7751;&#7693;an&#225;yaka</hi> Chandragupta, was in charge of a sub-division of 750 villages in the Khe&#7693;&#225; district at Harshapura apparently Harsol near Par&#225;ntij. The grant gives the name of Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a&#8217;s family as Br&#225;hma-vaka (?) and states that the family gained its fortune or Lakshm&#237; by the prowess of the feet of Ak&#225;lavarsha, showing that the members of the family drew their authority from Ak&#225;lavarsha. The grant mentions four of Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a&#8217;s ancestors, all of whom have non-Gujar&#225;t K&#225;narese-looking names. Though not independent rulers Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a&#8217;s ancestors seem to have been high R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a officers. The first is called &#346;uddha-kkumba&#7693;i, the second his son Dega&#7693;i, the third Dega&#7693;i&#8217;s son R&#225;jaham&#803;sa, the fourth R&#225;jaham&#803;sa&#8217;s son Dhavalappa the father of Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a and Akkuka. The plate describes R&#225;jaham&#803;sa as bringing back to his house its flying fortune as if he had regained lost authority. The plate describes Dhavalappa as killing the enemy in a moment and then giving to his lord the Ma&#7751;&#7693;ala or kingdom which the combined enemy, desirous of glory, had taken. This apparently refers to Ak&#225;lavarsha&#8217;s enemies abandoning Khe&#7789;aka with its Ma&#7751;&#7693;ala as mentioned in the late R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a Kard&#225; plate (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;973). Dhavalappa is probably Ak&#225;lavarsha&#8217;s general who fought and defeated the roaring Gurjjara, a success which may have led to Dhavalappa being placed in military charge of Gujar&#225;t.<note id="n129.2" n="2">It follows that none of Dhavalappa&#8217;s three ancestors had any connection with Gujar&#225;t.</note> The Kapadvanj (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;910) grant describes Dhavalappa&#8217;s son Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a with the feudatory title &#8216;Who has obtained the five great words.&#8217; Dr. Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l believed Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a to be a mere epithet of Akkuka, and took Chandragupta to be another name of the same person, but the published text gives the facts as above stated. The grantee is a Br&#225;hman and the grant is of the village of Vy&#225;ghr&#225;sa, perhaps V&#225;gr&#225; in Broach.<note id="n129.3" n="3">Dr. Hultsch (<abbr>Ep.

Both the Navs&#225;r&#237; plates of &#346;aka 836 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;914) note that the grants were made under peculiar conditions. The plates say that the donor Indra Nityam&#803;varsha, with his capital at M&#225;nyakheta, had come to a place named Kuru&#7751;&#7693;aka for the <hi>pa&#7789;&#7789;abandha</hi> or investiture festival. It is curious that though M&#225;nyakhe&#7789;a is mentioned as the capital the king is described as having come to Kuru&#7751;&#7693;aka for the investiture. Kuru&#7751;&#7693;aka was apparently not a large town as the plates mention that it was given in grant.<note id="n130.3" n="3">Kuru&#7751;&#7693;aka may be the village of Kurund in the Th&#225;na zilla seven miles north-east of Bhiwndi.

He weighed himself against gold or silver, and before leaving the scales he gave away Kuru&#7751;&#7693;aka and other places, twenty and a half l&#225;khs of dramma coins, and 400 villages previously granted but taken back by intervening kings. These details have an air of exaggeration. At the same time gifts of coins by <hi>l&#225;khs</hi> are not improbable by so mighty a king as Indra and as to the villages the bulk of them had already been alienated. The fact of lavish grants is supported by the finding of these two plates of the same date recording grants of two different villages made on the same occasion, the language being the same, and also by a verse in the late R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a Kard&#225; plate (&#346;. 894, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;972) where Indra is described as making numerous grants on copperplates and building many temples of &#346;iva.<note id="n130.4" n="4"><abbr expan="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">J.

[Dr. Bhand&#225;rkar reads the name in Indra&#8217;s Navs&#225;r&#237; grant (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;914) as Vennapa.]</note> The re-granting of so many villages points to the re-establishment of the main R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a power and the disappearance of the Gujar&#225;t branch of the R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as.<note id="n131.2" n="2">That in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;915 the Dakhan R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as held Gujar&#225;t as far north as Cambay is supported by the Arab traveller Al Mas&#250;di who (Prairies d&#8217;Or, I. 253&#8211;254) speaks of Cambay, when he visited it, as a flourishing town ruled by Bania the deputy of the <corr sic="Balhar&#225;">Balh&#225;ra</corr> lord of M&#225;nkir. The country along the gulf of Cambay was a succession of gardens villages fields and woods with date-palm and other groves alive with peacocks and parrots.</note>

 </p><p>Though no materials remain for fixing how long after <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;914 Gujar&#225;t belonged to the M&#225;nyakhe&#7789;a R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as, they probably continued to hold it till their destruction in &#346;aka 894 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;972) by the Western Ch&#225;lukya king Tailappa. This is the more likely as inscriptions show that till then the neighbours of Gujar&#225;t, the North Konkan &#346;il&#225;h&#225;ras, acknowledged R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a supremacy.

 </p><p>It is therefore probable that Gujar&#225;t passed to the conquering Tailappa as part of the R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a kingdom. Further, as noted below in Part II. Chapter II., it seems reasonable to suppose that about &#346;aka 900 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;978) Tailappa entrusted Gujar&#225;t to his general B&#225;rappa or Dv&#225;rappa, who fought with the <corr sic="Solanki">Solan&#775;ki</corr> M&#250;lar&#225;ja of <corr sic="Anahilav&#225;&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a</corr> (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;961&#8211;997).



 <q rend="block"><p>[The text does not carry the question of the origin of the R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as beyond the point that, about the middle of the fifth century <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>, two tribes bearing the closely associated names R&#225;tho&#7693; and Ra&#7789;&#7789;a, the leaders of both of which are known in Sanskrit as R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as, appeared the first in Upper India the second in the Bombay Kar&#7751;&#225;&#7789;ak, and that the traditions of both tribes seem to show they were either southerners or foreigners Br&#225;hmanised and included under the all-embracing term <corr sic="Rajput">R&#225;jput</corr>. The Sanskrit form R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a may mean either leaders of the R&#225;sh&#7789;ra tribe or heads of the territorial division named <hi>r&#225;shtra</hi>. The closely related forms R&#225;sh&#7789;rapati and Gr&#225;mak&#250;&#7789;a occur (above page 82) in Valabhi inscriptions. And Mr. Fleet (K&#225;narese Dynasties, 32) notices that R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a is used in the inscriptions of many dynasties as a title equivalent to R&#225;sh&#7789;rapati. Such a title might readily become a family name like that of the S&#225;hi J&#225;ts of the Panj&#225;b or the Mar&#225;thi surnames Patel, Nadkarni, and Des&#225;i. It may be noted that one of the M&#225;rw&#225;r traditions (<corr sic="Rajput&#225;na">R&#225;jput&#225;na</corr> Gazetteer, III. 246) connects the word R&#225;tho&#7693; with R&#225;sh&#7789;ra country making the original form R&#225;sh&#7789;ravara or World-blessing and referring to an early tribal guardian R&#225;sh&#7789;ra&#347;yena or the World-Falcon. It is therefore possible that the origin of both forms of the name, of R&#225;tho&#7693; as well as of R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a, is the title ruler of a district. At the same time in the case of the southern R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as the balance of evidence is in support of a tribal origin of the name. The Ra&#7789;&#7789;as of Saundatti in Belgaum, apparently with justice, claim descent from the former R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a rulers (Belgaum Gazetteer, 355). Further that the R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as considered themselves to belong to the Ra&#7789;&#7789;a tribe is shown by Indra Nityam&#803;varsha (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;914) <pb id="pb132" n="132"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter XI.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;743&#8211;974.</hi></item></list> </fw>calling himself Ra&#7789;&#7789;akandarpa the Love of the Ra&#7789;&#7789;as. The result is thus in agreement with the view accepted in the text that R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a means leaders of the Ra&#7789;&#7789;a tribe, the form R&#225;sh&#7789;ra being perhaps chosen because the leaders held the position of R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as or District Headmen. According to Dr. Bhand&#225;rkar (Deccan History, 9) the tribal name Ra&#7789;&#7789;a or R&#225;sh&#7789;ra enters into the still more famous Dakhan tribal name Mahar&#225;tha or Mahr&#225;tta. So far as present information goes both the Ra&#7789;&#7789;as and the Great Ra&#7789;&#7789;as are to be traced to the R&#225;stikas mentioned in number five of <corr sic="Asoka&#8217;s">A&#347;oka&#8217;s</corr> (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;245) Girn&#225;r edicts among the Apar&#225;ntas or westerners along with the Pete&#7751;ikas or people of Paithan about forty miles north-east of Ahmadnagar (Kolh&#225;pur Gazetteer, 82). Whether the R&#225;stika of the edicts is like Pete&#7751;ika a purely local name and if so why a portion of the north Dakhan should be specially known as the country or R&#225;sh&#7789;ra are points that must remain open.<note id="n132.1" n="1">It seems doubtful whether the K&#225;narese <choice><sic>Ra<hi>tt</hi>as</sic><corr>Ra&#7789;&#7789;as</corr></choice> the Belgaum <choice><sic>Ra<hi>d</hi>is</sic><corr>Ra&#7693;is</corr></choice> and the Telugu Reddis could have been R&#225;stikas or locals in the north Dakhan.

Soc.</abbr> XXXV. Part II. 129) has recorded the notable fact that the fine handsome Reddis of the north of the K&#225;nara country are like the J&#225;ts. With this personal resemblance may be compared the Reddis&#8217; curious form of polyandry (Balfour&#8217;s Encyclop&#230;dia, III. 330) in accordance with which the wife of the child-husband bears children to the adult males of the family, a practice which received theories (compare Mr. Kirkpatrick in <abbr expan="Indian Antiquary">Indian Ant.</abbr> VII. 86 and Dr. Muir in Ditto VI. 315) would associate with the northern or Skythian conquerors of Upper India during the early centuries of the Christian era.

 </p><p>The explanation that K&#250;&#7789;a the second half of R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a, means chief, has been accepted in the text. This is probably correct. At the same time the rival theory deserves notice that the name R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a is formed from two tribal names K&#250;&#7789;a representing the early widespread tribe allied to the Gonds known as Ko&#7789;&#7789;as and Ko&#7693;s in the Central Provinces North Konkan and Delhi (Th&#225;na Gazetteer, XII. Part II. 414). In support of this view it may be noticed that Abhimanyu&#8217;s fifth century R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a inscription (J. Bo. Br. R. As. XVI. 92) refers to the Ko&#7789;&#7789;as though as enemies not allies of the R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as. At the same time certain details in Abhimanyu&#8217;s grant favour an early R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a settlement in the Central Provinces, the probable head-quarters of the Ko&#7789;&#7789;as. The grant is dated from M&#225;napura and is made to Dakshi&#7751;a &#346;iva of Pe&#7789;hapan&#775;garaka which may be the Great &#346;iva shrine in the Mah&#225;dev hills in Hoshang&#225;b&#225;d, as this shrine is under the management of a petty chief of a place called Pag&#225;ra, and as M&#225;npur in the Vindhya hills is not far off. Against the tribal origin of the word K&#250;&#7789;a is to be set the fact that the northern Ra&#7789;&#7789;as are also called R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as though any connection between them and the Ko&#7789;&#7789;a tribe seems unlikely.

 </p><p>The question remains were the southern Ra&#7789;&#7789;as or R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as connected with the northern R&#225;tho&#7693;s or R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as. If so what was the nature of the connection and to what date does it belong. The fact that, while the later southern R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as <pb id="pb133" n="133"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter XI.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;743&#8211;974.</hi></item></list> </fw>call themselves Y&#225;davas of the Lunar race, the northerners claim descent either from Ku&#347;a the son of R&#225;ma or from Hira&#7751;yaka&#347;ipu would seem to prove no connection did not Abhimanyu&#8217;s fifth century grant show that in his time the southern R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as had not begun to claim Y&#225;dava descent. That the M&#225;rw&#225;r R&#225;tho&#7693;s trace their name to the <hi>r&#225;ht</hi> or spine of Indra (Tod&#8217;s Annals, II. 2), and in a closely similar fashion the R&#225;th or Rattu J&#225;ts of the Sutlej (Ibbetson&#8217;s 1881 Census, page 236) explain their name as stronghanded, and the Ra&#7789;&#7789;as of Bij&#225;pur (Bij&#225;pur Stat. Account, 145) trace their name to the K&#225;narese <hi>ra&#7789;&#7789;a</hi> right arm, may imply no closer connection than the common attempt to find a meaning for the name Ra&#7789;&#7789;a in a suitable word of similar sound. A legend preserved in the R&#225;jput&#225;na Gazetteer (III. 246), but not noted by Tod, tells how Sevji, after (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1139) the Musalm&#225;ns drove his father Jaichand out of Kanauj (Tod&#8217;s Annals, I. 88) took Khergad from the Gehlots and went to the Kar&#7751;&#225;&#7789;ak. where the R&#225;tho&#7693;s had ruled before they came to Kanauj. From the Kar&#7751;&#225;&#7789;ak Sevji brought the image of the R&#225;hto&#7693; R&#225;sh&#7789;ra&#347;yena which is now in the temple of N&#225;g&#225;na in Mev&#225;&#7693;. The account quoted in the text from Tod (Annals, I. 88) that the R&#225;tho&#7693;s who rose to power in M&#225;rw&#225;r in the thirteenth century belonged to a royal family who had held Kanauj since the fifth century has not stood the test of recent inquiry. It is now known that about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;470 Kanauj was in the hands of the Gupt&#225;s. That about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;600, according to the contemporary &#346;r&#237;harshacharita it was ruled by the Maukhari Grahavarm&#225;n who was put to death by a M&#225;lwa chief and was succeeded by Harsha. About <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;750, according to the R&#225;j&#225;taran&#775;gin&#237;, Kanauj was held by Ya&#347;ovarm&#225;n, and, in the next century, as inscriptions prove by the family of Bhoja. It was not till about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1050 that Kanauj was occupied by the G&#225;hadav&#225;la or G&#225;harw&#225;la family from whom the R&#225;tho&#7693;s of M&#225;rw&#225;r claim descent.<note id="n133.1" n="1">The eleventh century Kanauj G&#225;ha&#7693;av&#225;las are now represented by the Bundelas who about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1200 overthrew the Ch&#225;ndols in Bundelkhand. These G&#225;harw&#225;ls or Bundelas trace their origin to Benares or K&#225;si and may, as H&#339;rnle suggests, have been related to the P&#225;las of that city who several times intermarried with the Dakhan R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as. The G&#225;harw&#225;ls seem to have nothing to do with the district of Garhw&#225;l (Gadw&#225;l) in the Him&#225;layas.&#8212;(A. M. T. J.)</note> If the legendary connection of the M&#225;rw&#225;r R&#225;tho&#7693;s with Kanauj must be dismissed can the M&#225;rw&#225;r R&#225;tho&#7693;s be a branch of the southern R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as who like the Mar&#225;th&#225;s some 800 years later spread conquering northwards? Such a northern settlement of the southern R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as might be a consequence of the victories of the great R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a Dhruva who according to received opinions about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;790 conquered as far north as Allah&#225;b&#225;d. It is beyond question that southerners or Kar&#7751;&#225;&#7789;as were settled in North India between the seventh and the eleventh centuries. Still the latest information makes it improbable that Dhruva&#8217;s conquests extended further north than Gujar&#225;t. Nor has any special connection been traced between the southern R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as and the middle-age settlements of southerners or Kar&#7751;&#225;&#7789;as in North India.<note id="n133.2" n="2">The Vatsar&#225;ja defeated by Dhruva who has hitherto been identified with the Vatsa king of Kosambi is more likely to prove to be a Bachr&#225;ja of the Gurjjaras of Bh&#237;nm&#225;l or &#346;r&#237;m&#225;l in north Gujar&#225;t. Among references to southern settlements in North India between <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;600 and 1000 may be noted the tradition (Wilson&#8217;s Indian Caste, II. 143) of a Dravidian strain in the Kashmir Br&#225;hmans and in the eleventh century also in Kashmir (Raj&#225;tarangin&#237;, VI. 337) the presence of a &#346;&#225;tav&#225;hana dynasty bearing the same name as the early &#346;&#225;tav&#225;hanas of Paithan near Ahmadnagar. Other instances which might seem more directly associated with the southern R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;500&#8211;970) are the six K&#225;r&#7751;&#225;&#7789;aka rulers of Nep&#225;l beginning with <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;889 (<abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> VII. 91) and the natives of Kar&#7751;&#225;&#7789;ade&#347;a in M&#225;hm&#250;d Ghaznavi&#8217;s army (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1000&#8211;1025) who (Sachau&#8217;s Alberuni, I. 173; II. 157) used the Kar&#7751;&#225;&#7789;a alphabet. The presence of Kar&#7751;&#225;&#7789;a rulers in Nep&#225;l in the ninth and tenth centuries remains a puzzle. But the use of the term Kar&#7751;&#225;&#7789;a for Ch&#225;lukyas of Kaly&#225;n in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1000 (<abbr>Ep. Ind.</abbr> I. 230) suggests that the Nep&#225;l chiefs were Ch&#225;lukyas rather than R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as: while M&#225;hm&#250;d Ghaznavi&#8217;s Kar&#7751;&#225;&#7789;as may naturally be traced to the mercenary remains of B&#225;rappa&#8217;s army of Kaly&#225;n Ch&#225;lukyas whose general B&#225;rappa was slain (R&#225;s M&#225;l&#225;, I. 51) and his followers dispersed in north Gujar&#225;t by M&#250;la R&#225;ja <corr sic="Sola&#7751;ki">Solan&#775;ki</corr> at the close of the tenth century.

Several considerations make both of these solutions unlikely if not impossible. First there is the remarkably widespread existence of the name R&#225;htor, Ratha, or Ratti, and endless variations of these names, in almost all parts of the Panj&#225;b, among all castes from the Br&#225;hman to the Baluch, among all religions Musalm&#225;n, Sikh, Jain, and Br&#225;hmanic.<note id="n134.1" n="1">The details compiled from the excellent index and tables in the Panj&#225;b Census yield the following leading groups: 37 sub-castes named R&#225;thor, R&#225;tor, and other close variants; 53 Rath and <corr sic="R this">Rathis</corr> and 2 Rahtas; 50 Ratas, Ratis, or other close variants. Compare R&#225;hti the name of the people of Mount Abu (<corr sic="Rajput&#225;na">R&#225;jput&#225;na</corr> Gazetteer, III. 139) and the Raht tract in the north-west of Alvar (Ditto, 167).</note> No doubt the practice of a waning tribe adopting the name of a waxing tribe has always been common. No doubt also the fame of the name during the last 600 years must have tempted other classes to style themselves R&#225;tho&#7693;. Still it is to be noted: first that (Ibbetson, page 240) the R&#225;tho&#7693;s of the Panj&#225;b though widespread are not numerous: and second that the list of sub-caste-names has this merit that with a few exceptions the holders of the sub-name are not known by it but by some general or craft name. The evidence of these sub-caste or tribal names seems therefore to support the view that some very large section of the Panj&#225;b population represent an important tribe or nation of whom the least mixed remnant are perhaps the R&#225;this or lower class R&#225;jputs of K&#225;ngra and Chamba (Ibbetson, pages 219 and 251) and from some connection with whom the M&#225;rw&#225;r R&#225;tho&#7693;s of the thirteenth century may have taken their name. Among other traces of northern R&#225;sh&#7789;ras in the middle ages may be mentioned the twelfth and thirteenth century R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as of Badaun in the North-West Provinces (Kielhorn in Epigraphia Indica, I. 61 and 63) and (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1150) in the Kum&#225;rap&#225;la-Charitra (Tod&#8217;s Western India, 182) the mention of R&#225;sh&#7789;ra-de&#347;a near the Saw&#225;lak hills. Among earlier and more doubtful references are the Aratrioi whom probably correctly (since at that time <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;247 one main Roman trade route to Central Asia passed up the Indus) the author of the Periplus (McCrindle, 120) places between Abhiria or lower Sindh and Arachosia or south-east Afghanist&#225;n that is in north Sindh or south Panj&#225;b. Another earlier and still more doubtful reference is Pliny&#8217;s (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;77) Oratur&#230; (<abbr>Hist. Nat.</abbr> VI. 23) whom Vivien de St. Martin (<foreign lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr>Geog.</abbr> Greque et Latine de l&#8217;Inde</foreign>, 203) identifies with the R&#225;tho&#7693;s. The fact that while claiming descent from R&#225;ma the M&#225;rw&#225;r R&#225;tho&#7693;s (Tod&#8217;s Annals, II. 2 and 5) preserved the legend that their founder was Yavana&#347;wa from the northern city of Paralipur supports the view that the tribe to which they belonged was of non-Indian or Central Asian origin, and that this is the tribe of whom traces remain in the R&#225;thi R&#225;jputs of the K&#225;ngra hill country and less purely in the widely spread R&#225;ts, Rattas, and R&#225;tis of the Panj&#225;b plains. The examples among Panj&#225;b caste names Rora for Arora (Ibbetson&#8217;s 1881 Census, page 297), Her for Ahir (Ditto, 230&#8211;275), and Heri for Aheri (Ditto, 310) suggest that the Panj&#225;b R&#225;thors or Ra&#7789;&#7789;as may be the ancient Ara&#7789;&#7789;as whom the Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata (<abbr>Chap.</abbr> VII.

Remembering that the evidence (Kshatrapa Chapter, pages 22 and 33) favours the view that the Kshatrapa family who ruled the Panj&#225;b between <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;70 and <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;78 were of the same tribe as Nah&#225;pana, and also that Sh&#225;hi is so favourite a prefix in Samudra Gupta&#8217;s (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;380) list of Kush&#225;n tribes, the suggestion may be offered that Kshahar&#225;ta is the earlier form of Sh&#225;hara&#7789;&#7789;a and is the tribe of foreigners afterwards known in the Panj&#225;b as Ara&#7789;&#7789;as and of which traces survive in the present widespread tribal names R&#225;ta, Ratta, Ratha, and R&#225;thor.]</p></q>

After Skandagupta under the next known Gupta king Budhagupta (Gupta 165&#8211;180, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;484&#8211;499) no trace remains of Gupta sovereignty in Sorath. It is known that Budhagupta was a weak king and that the Gupta kingdom had already entered on its decline and lost its outlying provinces.

These powerful conquerors seem to be the tribe of Maitrakas mentioned in Valabhi copperplates as people who had settled in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a and established a <hi>ma&#7751;&#7693;ala</hi> or kingdom. Though these Maitrakas are mentioned in no other records from Sur&#225;sh&#7789;ra there seems reason to identify the Maitrakas with the Mihiras the well-known tribe of Mhers or Mers. In Sanskrit both <hi>mitra</hi> and <hi>mihira</hi> are names of the sun, and it would be quite in agreement with the practise of Sanskrit writers to use derivatives of the one for those of the other. These Mhers or Mers are still found in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a settled round the Barda hills while the Porbandar chiefs who are known as Jethv&#225;s are recognized as the head of the tribe. The name Jethv&#225; is not a tribal but a family name, being taken from the proper or personal name of the ancestor of the modern chiefs. As the Porbandar chiefs are called the kings of the Mhers they probably belong to the same tribe, though, being chiefs, they try, like other ruling families, to rank higher than their tribe tracing their origin from Han&#250;m&#225;n. Though the Jethv&#225;s appear to have been long ashamed to acknowledge themselves to belong to the Mher tribe the founders of minor Mher kingdoms called themselves Mher kings<corr>.</corr> The Porbandar chiefs have a tradition tracing their dynasty to Makaradhvaja son of Han&#250;m&#225;n, and there are some <corr sic="Pur&#225;nik">Pur&#225;&#7751;ic</corr> legends attached to the tradition. The historical kernel of the tradition appears to be that the Mhers or Jethv&#225;s had a <hi>makara</hi> or fish as their flag or symbol. One of the mythical stories of Makaradhvaja is that he fought with May&#250;radhvaja. Whatever coating of fable may have overlaid the story, it contains a grain of history. May&#250;radhvaja stands for the Guptas whose chief symbol was a peacock <hi>may&#250;ra</hi>, and with them Makaradhvaja that is the people with the fish-symbol that is <pb id="pb136" n="136"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter XII.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Mers, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;470&#8211;900.</hi></item></list> </fw>the Mhers had a fight. This fight is probably the historical contest in which the Mhers fought with and overthrew the Gupta Viceroy of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a.

 </p><p>The K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a Mhers are a peculiar tribe whose language dress and appearance mark them as foreign settlers from Upper India. Like the M&#225;lavas, J&#225;ts, <corr sic="Gurjaras">Gurjjaras</corr>, and Pahlavas, the Mhers seem to have passed through the Punj&#225;b Sindh and North Gujar&#225;t into K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a leaving settlements at Ajm&#237;r, B&#225;dner, Jesalm&#237;r, Kokalm&#237;r, and Mherv&#225;&#7693;a. How and when the Mhers made these settlements and entered K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a is not known. It may be surmised that they came with Toram&#225;&#7751;a (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;470&#8211;512) who overthrew the Guptas, and advanced far to the south and west in the train of some general of Toram&#225;&#7751;a&#8217;s who may perhaps have entered Sur&#225;sh&#7789;ra. This is probable as the date of Toram&#225;&#7751;a who overthrew Budhagupta is almost the same as that of the Maitrakas mentioned as the opponents and enemies of Bha&#7789;&#225;rka. In the time of Bha&#7789;&#225;rka (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;509&#8211;520?) the Mhers were firmly established in the peninsula, otherwise they would not be mentioned in the Valabhi grants as enemies of Bha&#7789;&#225;rka, a tribe or <hi>ma&#7751;&#7693;ala</hi> wielding incomparable power. As stated above in Chapter VIII. some time after the Mher settlement and consolidation of power, Bha&#7789;&#225;rka seems to have come as general of the fallen Guptas through M&#225;lwa and Broach by sea to East K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a. He established himself at Valabhi and then gradually dislodged the Mhers from Sorath until they retired slightly to the north settling eventually at Morbi, which the Jethv&#225;s still recognize as the earliest seat of their ancestors. At Morbi they appear to have ruled contemporarily with the Valabhis. In support of this it is to be noted that no known Valabhi plate records any grant of lands or villages in H&#225;l&#225;r, Machhuk&#225;ntha, or Okh&#225;mandal in North K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a. As the northmost place mentioned in Valabhi plates is Venuthali known as Wania&#8217;s Vanthali in H&#225;l&#225;r it may be inferred that not the Valabhis but the Mhers ruled the north coast of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a, probably as feudatories or subordinates of the Valabhis. On the overthrow of Valabhi about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;770 the Mhers appear to have seized the kingdom and ruled the whole of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a dividing it into separate chiefships grouped under the two main divisions of Bard&#225;i and Gohelv&#225;dia. About <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;860 the Mhers made incursions into Central Gujar&#225;t. A copperplate dated &#346;aka 789 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;847) of the Gujar&#225;t R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a king Dhruva describes him as attacked by a powerful Mihira king whom he defeated.<note id="n136.1" n="1"><abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> XII. 179.</note> At the height of their power the Mhers seem to have established their capital at the fort of Bhumli or Ghumli in the Bard&#225; hills in the centre of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a. The traditions about Ghumli rest mainly on modern Jethv&#225; legends of no historical interest. The only known epigraphical record is a copperplate of a king named J&#226;chikadeva found in the Morbi district.<note id="n136.2" n="2"><abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> II. 257.</note> Unfortunately only the second plate remains.

The date of the grant is 585 Gupta era the 5th Ph&#225;lguna Sudi that is <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;904, about 130 years after the destruction of Valabhi, a date with which the form of the letters agrees.

 </p><p>A similar copperplate in which the king&#8217;s name appears in the slightly different form J&#225;ikadeva has been found at Dhiniki in the same neighbourhood as the first and like it bearing the fish mark.<note id="n137.1" n="1"><abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> XII. 151.</note> This copperplate describes the king as ruling at Bh&#250;milik&#225; or Bh&#250;mli in Sorath and gives him the high titles of <foreign lang="sa-latn" xml:lang="sa-latn">Parama-bha&#7789;&#7789;&#225;raka-Mah&#225;r&#225;j&#225;dhir&#225;ja-Parame&#347;vara</foreign>, that is Great Lord Great King of Kings Great King, titles which imply wide extent and independence of rule. This grant purports to be made on the occasion of a solar eclipse on Sunday Vikrama Sam&#803;vat 794 <corr sic="Jyesh&#7789;h&#803;a">Jyesh&#7789;ha</corr> constellation, the no-moon of the second half of K&#225;rttika. This would be <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;738 or 166 years before the J&#225;chika of the Morb&#237; plate. Against this it is to be noted that the letters of this plate, instead of appearing as old as eighth century letters, look later than the letters of the tenth century Morb&#237; plate. As neither the day of the week, the constellation, nor the eclipse work out correctly Dr. Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l believed the plate to be a forgery of the eleventh century, executed by some one who had seen a fish-marked copperplate of J&#225;chika dated in the <hi>&#346;aka</hi> era. It should however be noted that the names of ministers and officers which the plate contains give it an air of genuineness. Whether the plate is or is not genuine, it is probably true that <corr sic="J&#225;ikadev">J&#225;ikadeva</corr> was a great independent sovereign ruling at Bh&#250;mli. Though the names of the other kings of the dynasty, the duration of the Bh&#250;mli kingdom, and the details of its history are unknown it may be noted that the dynasty is still represented by the Porbandar chiefs. Though at present Bh&#250;mli is deserted several ruined temples of about the eleventh century stand on its site. It is true no old inscriptions have been found; it is not less true that no careful search has been made about Bh&#250;mli.

 </p><p>Early in the tenth century a wave of invasion from Sindh seems to have spread over Kacch and K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a. Among the invading tribes were the J&#225;dej&#225;s of Kacch and the <corr sic="Chu&#7693;&#225;sam&#225;s">Ch&#250;&#7693;&#225;sam&#225;s</corr> of Sorath, who like the Bhattis of Jesalm&#237;r call themselves of the Yaduvam&#803;&#347;a stock. Doctor Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l held that the <corr sic="Ch&#250;&#7693;asam&#225;s">Ch&#250;&#7693;&#225;sam&#225;s</corr> were originally of the &#193;bh&#237;ra tribe, as their traditions attest <corr sic="connexion">connection</corr> with the &#193;bh&#237;ras and as the description of Graharipu one of their kings by Hemachandra in his Dvy&#225;&#347;raya points to his being of some local tribe and not of any ancient R&#225;jput lineage. Further in their bardic traditions as well as in popular stories the Ch&#250;&#7693;&#225;sam&#225;s are still commonly called &#193;hera-r&#225;n&#225;s. The position of Aberia in Ptolemy (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;150) seems to show that in the second century the Ahirs were settled between Sindh and the Panj&#225;b. Similarly it may be suggested that J&#225;dej&#225; is a corruption of Jaudhej&#225; which <pb id="pb138" n="138"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter XII.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Mers, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;470&#8211;900.</hi></item></list> </fw>in turn comes from Yaudheya (the change of <hi>y</hi> to <hi>j</hi> being very common) who in Kshatrapa Inscriptions appear as close neighbours of the Ahirs. After the fall of the Valabhis (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;775) the Yaudheyas seem to have established themselves in Kacch and the Ahirs settled and made conquests in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a. On the decline of local rule brought about by these incursions and by the establishment of an Ahir or Ch&#250;&#7693;&#225;sam&#225; kingdom at Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h, the Jethv&#225;s seem to have abandoned Bh&#250;mli which is close to Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h and gone to Sr&#237;nagar or K&#225;&#7751;telun near Porbandar which is considered to have been the seat of Jethv&#225; power before Porbandar.

 </p><p>A copperplate found at Hadd&#225;l&#225; on the road from Dholka to Dhandhuka dated <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;917 (&#346;aka 839) shows that there reigned at Vadhw&#225;n a king named Dhara&#7751;&#237;var&#225;ha of the Ch&#225;pa dynasty,<note id="n138.1" n="1">The inscription calls Ch&#225;pa the founder of the dynasty. The name is old. A king Vy&#225;ghrar&#225;ja of the Ch&#225;pa Vam&#803;&#347;a, is mentioned by the astronomer Brahmagupta as reigning in &#346;aka 550 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;628) when he wrote his book called Brahma-Gupta Siddh&#225;nta. The entry runs &#8220;In the reign of &#346;r&#237; Vy&#225;ghramukha of the &#346;r&#237; Ch&#225;pa dynasty, five hundred and fifty years after the &#346;aka king having elapsed.&#8221; <abbr>Jour.

Dhara&#7751;&#237;var&#225;ha and his ancestors are described as feudatory kings, ruling by the grace of the feet of the great king of kings the great lord the illustrious Mah&#237;p&#225;ladeva. This Mah&#237;p&#225;la would seem to be some great king of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a reigning in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;917 over the greater part of the province. Dr. Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l had two coins of this king of about that time, one a copper coin the other a silver coin. The coins were found near Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h. The copper coin, about ten grains in weight, has one side obliterated but the other side shows clearly the words R&#225;n&#225; &#346;r&#237; Mah&#237;p&#225;la Deva. The silver coin, about fourteen grains in weight, has on the obverse a well-executed elephant and on the reverse the legend R&#225;n&#225; &#346;r&#237; Mah&#237;p&#225;la Deva. From the locality where the name Mah&#237;p&#225;la appears both in coins and inscriptions, and from the fact that the more reliable Ch&#250;&#7693;&#225;sam&#225; lists contain similar names, it may be assumed as probable that Mah&#237;p&#225;la was a powerful Ch&#250;&#7693;&#225;sam&#225; ruler of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a in the early part of the tenth century.

 </p><p>After the fall of Valabhi no other reliable record remains of any dynasty ruling over the greater part of Gujar&#225;t. The most trustworthy and historical information is in connection with the Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s of A&#7751;ahilapura. Even for the Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s nothing is available but scant references recorded by Jain authors in their histories of the Solan&#775;kis and V&#225;ghel&#225;s.

Traces of a different tradition are to be found in the Tuhfat-ul-Kir&#225;m (Elliot, I. 337) which gives a list of <corr sic="Ch&#250;&#7693;&#225;samm&#225;&#8217;s">Ch&#250;&#7693;&#225;sam&#225;&#8217;s</corr> ancestors from Nuh (Noah), including not only <corr sic="Krish&#7751;a">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</corr> the Y&#225;dava but also R&#225;ma of the solar line. In this pedigree the Musalm&#225;n element is later than the others: but the attempt to combine the solar and lunar lines is a sure sign that the Samma clan was not of Hindu origin, and that it came under Hindu influence fairly late though before Sindh became a Musalm&#225;n province. This being admitted it follows that the Sammas were one of the numerous tribes that entered India during the existence of the Turkish empire in Transoxiana (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;560&#8211;c. 750). In this connection it is noteworthy that some of the J&#225;ms bore such Turkish names as Tam&#225;chi, Tughlik, and Sanj&#225;r.

 </p><p>The migration of the Sammas to Kacch is ascribed by the Tar&#237;kh-i-Tahiri (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1621) to the tyranny of the S&#250;mra chiefs. The Sammas found Kacch in the possession of the Ch&#225;waras, who treated them kindly, and whom they requited by seizing the fort of G&#250;ntr&#237; by a stratagem similar to that which brought about the fall of Girn&#225;r.

 </p><p>The date of the Ch&#250;&#7693;&#225;sam&#225; settlement at Vanthal&#237; is usually fixed on traditional evidence, at about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;875, but there is reason to think that this date is rather too early. In the first place it is worthy of notice that Ch&#250;&#7693;&#225;chandra, the traditional eponym of the family, is in the Tuhfat-ul-Kir&#225;m made a son of J&#225;dam (Y&#225;dava) and only a great-grandson of <corr sic="Krish&#7751;a">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</corr> himself, a fact which suggests that, if not entirely mythical, he was at all events a very distant ancestor of M&#250;lar&#225;ja&#8217;s opponent Grah&#225;ri, and was not an actual ruler of Vanthal&#237;. As regards Grah&#225;ri&#8217;s father Vi&#347;vavar&#225;ha and his grandfather M&#250;lar&#225;ja, there is no reason to doubt that they were real persons, although it is very questionable whether the Ch&#250;&#7693;&#225;sam&#225;s were settled in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a in their time. In the first place, the Morb&#237; grant of J&#225;ikadeva shows that the Jethv&#225;s had not been driven southwards before <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;907. Secondly Dhara&#7751;&#237;var&#225;ha&#8217;s Vadhv&#225;n grant proves that the Ch&#225;pa family of Bh&#237;nm&#225;l were still supreme in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;914: whereas the Tar&#237;kh-i-Tahiri&#8217;s account of the Ch&#250;&#7693;&#225;sam&#225; conquest of Kacch implies that the Ch&#225;waras, who must be identified with the Ch&#225;pas of Bh&#237;nm&#225;l, were losing their power when the Ch&#250;&#7693;&#225;sam&#225;s captured G&#250;ntr&#237;, an event which must have preceded the settlement at Vanthal&#237; in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a. Beyond the fact that M&#250;lar&#225;ja Solan&#775;ki transferred the capital to <corr sic="Anahilav&#225;&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a</corr> in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;942, we know nothing of the events which led to the break-up of the Bh&#237;nm&#225;l empire.

Some of these identifications are doubtful. Dr. <corr sic="Bhangv&#225;nl&#225;l">Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l</corr> in the text (21 Note 6 and 33) distinguishes between the Mevas or Medas whom he identifies as northern immigrants of about the first century <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi> and the Mers. This view is in agreement with the remark in the <corr sic="Rajput&#225;na">R&#225;jput&#225;na</corr> Gazetteer, I. 66, that the Mers have been suspected to be a relic of the Indo-Skythian Meds. Again Tod (Annals of Rajasth&#225;n, I. 9) derives Mev&#225;&#7693;a from <hi>madhya</hi> (Sk.) middle, and the Mer of Merw&#225;&#7693;a from <hi>meru</hi> a hill. In support of Tod&#8217;s view it is to be noted that the forts Balmer Jesalmer Komalmer and Ajmer, which Pandit Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l would derive from the personal names of Mer leaders, are all either hill forts or rocks (Annals, I. 11, and Note &#8224;). It is, on the other hand, to be noted that no hill forts out of this particular tract of country are called Mers, and that the similar names Koli and Malava, which with equal probability as Medh might be derived from Koh and Mala hill, seem to be tribal not geographical names.</note> In Gujar&#225;t <pb id="pb141" n="141"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter XII.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Mers, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;470&#8211;900.</hi></item><item>The Mers.</item></list> </fw>their strength is much greater than the 30,000 or 40,000 returned as <note place="margin">The Mers.</note>Mers. One branch of the tribe is hidden under the name Koli; another has disappeared below the covering of Isl&#225;m.<note id="n141.1" n="1">The tales cited in the R&#225;s M&#225;l&#225; (I. 103) prove that most of the Kolis between Gujar&#225;t and K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a are Mairs. That till the middle of the tenth century the south-east of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a was held by Medhs (K&#225;th. Gazetteer, 672) supports the view that the Kolis, whom about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1190 (Tod&#8217;s Western India, I. 265) the Gohils drove out of the island of Piram, were Medhs, and this is in agreement with <corr sic="Idris&#237;">Idr&#237;si</corr> (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1130 Elliot, I. 83) who calls both Piram and the Medhs by the name Mand. Similarly some of the Koli clans of Kacch (Gazetteer, 70) seem to be descended from the Medhs. And according to Mr. Dalpatram Khakkar three subdivisions of Brahmo-Kshatris, of which the best known are the Mansura Mers and the Pipalia Mers, maintain the surname Mair or Mer. (Cutch Gazetteer, 52 note 2.) Mera or Mehra is a common surname among Sindhi Baluchis. Many of the best Musalm&#225;n captains and pilots from K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a, Kacch, and the Makr&#225;n coast still have Mer as a surname. Mehr is also a favourite name among both Khoj&#225;hs and Memans, the two special classes of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a converts to Isl&#225;m. The Khoj&#225;hs explain the name as meaning Meher Ali the friend of Ali; the Memans also explain Mer as Meher or friend. But as among Memans Mer is a common name for women as well as for men the word can hardly mean friend. The phrase Merba&#237; or Lady Mer applied to Meman mothers seems to have its origin in the R&#225;jput practice of calling the wife by the name of her caste or tribe as K&#225;thi&#225;n&#237;ba&#237;, Meran&#237;ba&#237;. In the case both of the Khoj&#225;hs and the Memans the name Mer seems to be the old tribal name continued because it yielded itself to the uses of Isl&#225;m. Mehr, Mihr, and Mahar are also used as titles of respect. The Kh&#225;nt Kolis of Girn&#225;r, apparently a mixture of the Maitrakas of the text and of a local hill tribe, still (K&#225;thi&#225;w&#225;r Gazetteer, 142) honour their leaders with the name Mer explaining the title by the Gujar&#225;ti mer the main bead in a rosary. Similarly in <corr sic="M&#225;lw&#225;">M&#225;lwa</corr> a Gurjjara title is Mihr (R&#225;jput&#225;na Gazetteer, I. 80) and in the Panj&#225;b M&#225;har (Gazetteer of <corr sic="Panjab">Panj&#225;b</corr>, Gujr&#225;t, 50&#8211;51). And in Kacch the headman among the Bharw&#225;ds, who according to some accounts are Gurjjar&#225;s, is called Mir (Cutch Gazetteer, 81). Similarly among the Rab&#225;ris of Kacch the name of the holy she-camel is M&#225;ta Meri. (Ditto, 80.) All these terms of respect are probably connected with Mihira, Sun.</note>

 </p><p>Formerly except the vague contention that the Medh&#225;s, Jhetv&#225;s, and Jh&#225;la-Makv&#225;n&#225;s were northerners of somewhat recent arrival little evidence was available either to fix the date of their appearance in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a or to determine to which of the many swarms of non-Hindu Northerners they belonged.<note id="n141.2" n="2">Compare Tod (Western India, 420): Though enrolled among the thirty-six royal races we may assert the Jethv&#225;s have become Hindus only from locality and circumstance. Of the Jh&#225;l&#225;s Tod says (Rajasth&#225;n, I. 113): As the Jh&#225;l&#225;s are neither Solar Lunar nor Agnikula they must be strangers. Again (Western India, 414): The Jh&#225;l&#225; Makv&#225;n&#225;s are a branch of H&#250;&#7751;as. Of the name Makv&#225;na (K&#225;thi&#225;w&#225;r Gazetteer, 111; R&#225;s M&#225;l&#225;, I. 297) two explanations may be offered, either that the word comes from M&#225;k the dewy tracts in Central Kacch (Cutch Gazetteer, 75 note 2) where (K&#225;thi&#225;w&#225;r Gazetteer, 420) the Jh&#225;l&#225;s stopped when the Mers and Jethv&#225;s passed south, or that Makv&#225;na represents Mauna a <corr sic="Puranic">Pur&#225;&#7751;ic</corr> name for the H&#250;&#7751;as (Wilson&#8217;s Works, IV. 207). Tod&#8217;s and Wilford&#8217;s (Asiatic Researches, IX. 287) suggestion that Makv&#225;na is Mah&#225;huna is perhaps not phonetically possible. At the same time that the <corr sic="M&#225;kv&#225;nas">Makv&#225;n&#225;s</corr> are a comparatively recent tribe of northerners is supported by the ascendancy in the fourteenth century in the Him&#225;layas of Makv&#225;nis (Hodgson&#8217;s Essays, I. 397; Government of India Selections XLVII. 54 and 119) who used the Indo-Skythian title S&#225;h (Ditto). With the Nepal Makv&#225;nis may be compared the Makpons or army-men the caste of the chief of Baltist&#225;n or Little Tibet. Vigne&#8217;s Kashmir, II. 258, 439.</note> This point Dr. Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l&#8217;s remarks in the text go far to clear. The chief step is the identification of the Mers with the Maitrakas, the ruling power in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a between the decline of the Guptas about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;470 and the establishment of Valabhi rule about sixty years later.

 </p><p>Though the sameness in name between the Mihiras and Mihirakula (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;508&#8211;530), the great Indian champion of the White H&#250;&#7751;as, may not imply sameness of tribe it points to a common sun-worship.<note id="n142.2" n="2">Mr. Fleet (Epigraphia Indica, III. 327 and note 12) would identify Mihirakula&#8217;s tribe with the Maitrakas. More recent evidence shows that his and his father <corr sic="Toroma&#7751;a&#8217;s">Toram&#225;&#7751;a&#8217;s</corr> tribe was the J&#225;uvlas. That the White H&#250;&#7751;as or other associated tribes were sun-worshippers appears from a reference in one of Mihirakula&#8217;s inscriptions (<foreign lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum</foreign>, III. 161) to the building of a specially fine temple of the sun; and from the fact that in Kashm&#237;r Mihirakula founded a city Mihirapura and a temple to Mihireshwar. (Darmsteter in Journal Asiatique, X. 70: Fleet in Indian Antiquary, XV. 242&#8211;252.) Mihirakula&#8217;s (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;508&#8211;530) sun-worship may have been the continuance of the <corr sic="Kushan">Kush&#225;n</corr> (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;50&#8211;150) worship of Mithro or Helios (Wilson&#8217;s Ariana Antiqua, 357). At the same time the fact that Mihirakula uses the more modern form Mihir makes it probable (Compare Rawlinson&#8217;s Seventh Monarchy, 284) that Mihirakula&#8217;s sun-worship was more directly the result of the spread of sun-worship in Central Asia under the fiercely propagandist Sassanians Varahan V. or Behram Gor (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;420&#8211;440), and his successors Izdigerd II. (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;440&#8211;457), and Perozes (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;457&#8211;483). The extent to which Zoroastrian influence pervaded the White H&#250;&#7751;as is shown by the Persian name not only of Mihirakula but of Kushnawaz (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;470&#8211;490) the great emperor of the White H&#250;&#7751;as the overthrower of Perozes. That this Indian sun-worship, which, at latest, from the seventh to the tenth century made Mult&#225;n so famous was not of local origin is shown by the absence of reference to sun-worship in Mult&#225;n in the accounts of Alexander the Great. Its foreign origin is further shown by the fact that in the time of Beruni (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1020 Sachau&#8217;s Edition, I. 119) the priests were called Maghas and the image of the sun was clad in a northern dress falling to the ankles. It is remarkable as illustrating the Hindu readiness to adopt priests of conquering tribes into the ranks of Br&#225;hmans that the surname Magha survives (Cutch Gazetteer, 52 note 2) among Shrim&#225;li Br&#225;hmans. These Maghas are said to have married Bhoja or <corr sic="Rajput">R&#225;jput</corr> girls and to have become the Br&#225;hman Bhojaks of Dw&#225;rka. Even the Mands who had &#346;aka wives, whose descendants were named Mandagas, obtained a share in the temple ceremonies.

 </p><p>That the Mult&#225;n sun-worship was introduced under Sassanian influence is supported by the fact (Wilson&#8217;s Ariana Antiqua, 357) that the figure of the sun on the fifth century Hindu sun coins is in the dress of a Persian king<corr sic=":">;</corr> that the priests who performed the Mult&#225;n sun-worship were called Magas; and by the details of the dress and ritual in the account of the introduction of sun-worship given in the Bhavishya Pur&#225;na.<note id="n142.3" n="3">Wilson&#8217;s <corr sic="Vishnu">Vish&#7751;u</corr> Pur&#225;na Preface <hi rend="sc">XXXIX.</hi> in Reinaud&#8217;s <foreign lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M&#233;moire Sur l&#8217;Inde</foreign>, 391.

The name Mihiraga suggests that the spread of sun-worship in the Panj&#225;b and Sindh, of which the sun-worship in Mult&#225;n Sindh K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a and Mew&#225;&#7693; and the fire-worshipping <corr sic="Rajput">R&#225;jput</corr> and Sindh coins of the fifth and sixth centuries are evidence, was helped by the spread of Sassanian influence <pb/>into Baluchist&#225;n Kacch-Gandevi and other parts of western Sindh, through Sakastene the modern western Seistan near the lake Helmund. This Sakastene or land of the &#346;akas received its name from the settlement in it of one of the earlier waves of the Yuechi in the second or first century before Christ. The name explains the statement in the Bhavishya Pur&#225;na that sun-worship was introduced by Magas into Mult&#225;n from Sakadvipa the land of the &#346;akas. In this connection it is interesting to note that Darmsteter (Zend Avesta, xxxiv.) holds that the Zend Avesta was probably completed during the reign of Sh&#225;hpur II. (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;309&#8211;379): that (lxxxix.) Zend was a language of eastern Persia an earlier form of Pashtu; and that (lxxxiv.) western Seistan and the Helmund river was the holy land of the Avesta the birth-place of Zoroaster and the scene of king Vishtasp&#8217;s triumphs. A memory of the spread of this western or Sassanian influence remains in the reference in the Mujmalu-T-Taw&#225;rikh in Elliot, I. 107&#8211;109, to the fire temples established in Kandabil (Gandevi) and Buddha (Mansura) by Mahra a general of Bahman that is of Varahran V. (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;420&#8211;440). It seems probable that Mahra is Mehr the family name or the title (Rawlinson&#8217;s Sassanian Monarchy, 224 note 4 and 312) of the great Mihran family of Persian nobles. The general in question may be the Mehr-Narses the minister of Varahran&#8217;s son and successor Izdigerd II. (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;440&#8211;457), who enforced Zoroastrianism in Armenia (Rawlinson, Ditto 305&#8211;308). Mehr&#8217;s success may be the origin of the Indian stories of Varahran&#8217;s visit to <corr sic="M&#225;lw&#225;">M&#225;lwa</corr>. It may further be the explanation of the traces of fire temples and towers of silence noted by Pottinger (1810) in Baluchist&#225;n (Travels, 126&#8211;127) about sixty miles west of Khelat.</note> The third class whom the Bhavishya Pur&#225;na associates with the introduction of sun-worship are the M&#226;nas who <pb id="pb143" n="143"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter XII.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Mers, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;470&#8211;900.</hi></item><item>White H&#250;&#7751;as.</item></list> </fw>are given a place between the Magas and the Mands.

Their widespread and unchallenged dominion in North India, the absence of record of any reverse later than the Karur defeat, the hopelessness of any attempt to pass out of India in the face of the combined Turk and Sassanian forces make it probable that the H&#250;&#7751;as and their associated tribes, adopting Hinduism and abandoning their claim to supremacy, settled in west and north-west India. This view finds support in the leading place which the H&#250;&#7751;as and H&#225;ra-H&#250;&#7751;as, the Maitrakas or Mers, and the Gurjjaras hold in the centuries that follow the overthrow of the White H&#250;&#7751;a empire. According to one rendering of Cosmas<note id="n143.2" n="2">Compare Priaulx&#8217;s Embassies, 222.</note> (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;525) the chief of Orrhotha or Sorath in common with several other coast rulers owed allegiance to Gollas, apparently, as is suggested at page 75 of the text, to Gulla or Mihirgulla the Indian Emperor of the White H&#250;&#7751;as. These details support the view that the Maitrakas, Mihiras, or Mers who in Cosmas&#8217; time were in power in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a, and to whose ascendancy during the seventh and eighth centuries both the Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsiang (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;612&#8211;640) and the Arab historians of Sindh bear witness, were a portion of the great White H&#250;&#7751;a invasion (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;480&#8211;530).<note id="n143.3" n="3">The White H&#250;&#7751;as overran Bakhtria and the country of the Yuechi between <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;450 and 460.

Chinese authorities place it beyond doubt that when, towards the middle of the fifth century <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>, the White H&#250;&#7751;as crossed the Oxus they found in power a cognate tribe of northerners whose date of settlement on the Indian frontier was less than a century old. This preceding swarm was the Yu&#225;n-Yu&#225;n, Var-Var, or Av&#225;r, who, about the close of the fourth century (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;380), had driven from Balkh southwards into the <corr sic="Kabul">K&#225;bul</corr> valley Kitolo the last ruler of the long established Yuetchi (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi> 50&#8211;<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;380).<note id="n144.1" n="1">Specht in Journal Asiatique (1883), II. 348.</note> It is known that in retreating before the Yu&#225;n-Yu&#225;n a division of the Baktrian Yuetchi, under the leadership of Kitolo&#8217;s son, under the name of the Kid&#225;ras or Little Yuetchi, established their power in Gandh&#225;ra and Pesh&#225;war.<note id="n144.2" n="2">Specht in Journal Asiatique (1883), II. 349.</note> This Kid&#225;ra invasion must have driven a certain share of the people of the <corr sic="Kabul">K&#225;bul</corr> valley to the east of the Indus.

The welcome given to the H&#250;&#7751;as, and the show and dash which marked their century of ascendancy in India and Persia, make it probable that as leaders they conducted south as far as K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a and M&#225;lava large bodies of the earlier northern settlers. To which of the waves of earlier northerners the Medhs belonged is doubtful.<note id="n144.4" n="4">Dr. Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l (Text, 33) traces one set of Medhs to the Mevas the tribe of Ysamotika the father of the Kshatrapa <corr sic="Chashta&#7751;a">Chash&#7789;ana</corr> (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;130).

At the same time he seems to have considered those early Mevas different from the fifth and sixth century Mihiras and from the seventh and eighth century Medhs.</note> The view held by Pandit Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l that one branch of the Medhs entered India in the first century before Christ among the tribes of which the great Yuechi were the chief is on the whole in agreement with General Cunningham&#8217;s argument that Medus Hydaspes, Virgil&#8217;s phrase for the Jhelum, proves that the Medhs were then (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;40) already settled on its banks.<note id="n144.5" n="5"><abbr expan="Arch&#230;ological">Arch.</abbr> Report for 1863&#8211;64, II. 52. In support of this Cunningham cites Ptolemy&#8217;s (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;150) Euthymedia that is Sagala, sixty miles north-west of Lahor, and the Media of Peutinger&#8217;s Tables (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;400). This Euthymedia is a corruption of the original Euthydemia the name given to Sagala by Demetrios (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;190) the great Gr&#230;co-Baktrian in honour of his father Euthydemos (Compare Text page 16 and McCrindle&#8217;s Ptolemy, 124). Of the cause of this change of name, which may be only a clerical error, two different explanations have been offered. Tod (An. of Rajn. I. 233) would make the new form Yuthi-media the Middle Yuchi. Cunningham (<abbr expan="Arch&#230;ological Survey Report">Arch. Surv. Rep.</abbr> II. 53) would attribute it to the southward migration towards Sindh about <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;50 of the Kush&#225;n-pressed horde which under Moas or Mogha came from Little Tibet and entered the Panj&#225;b either by way of Kashm&#237;r or down the Sw&#225;t valley. According to General Cunningham (Ditto, 53) the followers of this Moas were Mandrueni called after the Mandrus river south of the Oxus. The two forms Medh and Mand are due to the cerebral which explains the Minnagaras of Ptolemy and the Periplus; Masudi&#8217;s (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;915) Mind and Ibn <corr sic="Khurdadbha&#8217;s">Khurd&#225;dbha&#8217;s</corr> <pb/>(died <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;912) and <corr sic="Idris&#237;&#8217;s">Idr&#237;si&#8217;s</corr> (perhaps from <corr sic="Aldjayh&#225;ni" resp="errata">Aljauhari</corr>) Mand (Elliot, I. 14 and 79, Reinaud&#8217;s Abulfeda, lxiii.); the present associated Mers and Mins in <corr sic="Rajput&#225;na">R&#225;jput&#225;na</corr> (Ditto, 53); and perhaps the Musalm&#225;n Meos and Minas of the Panj&#225;b (Ibbetson&#8217;s Census, 261).</note>

Gaz. 138); they entered K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a along with the Medhs (Ditto, 278).</note> and is not inconsistent with Tod&#8217;s opinions.<note id="n145.2" n="2">The passages are somewhat contradictory. Tod (Western India, 413) says: Jethv&#225;s marry with K&#225;this, Ahirs, and Mers. In the K&#225;thi&#225;w&#225;r Gazetteer (page 110) Colonel Barton seems to admit the Jethv&#225;s&#8217; claim to be of distinct origin from the Mers. In another passage he says (page 138): The Mers claim to be Jethv&#225;s: this the Jethv&#225;s deny. So also Colonel Watson in one passage (page 621) seems to favour a distinct origin while in another (page 279) he says: It seems probable the Jethv&#225;s are merely the ruling family R&#225;jkula of the Mers and that they are all of one tribe. Two points seem clear. The Jethv&#225;s are admitted to rank among K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a <corr sic="Rajputs">R&#225;jputs</corr> and they formerly married with the Mers. The further question whether the Jethv&#225;s were originally of a distinct and higher tribe remains undetermined.</note> Still though the Hindu ruler-worship, which, as in the case of the Mar&#225;tha <corr sic="Siv&#225;ji">&#346;iv&#225;ji</corr>, explains the raising to the twice-born of leaders of successful early and foreign tribes makes it possible that the Jethv&#225;s were originally Mers, it seems on the whole probable that the Jethv&#225;s&#8217; claim to an origin distinct from the Mers is well founded. The evidence recorded by Colonel Tod and the name Jethva led the late Dr. John Wilson to trace the Jethv&#225;s to the J&#225;ts or Jits.<note id="n145.3" n="3">Bombay Administration Report for 1873. Colonel Tod made the same suggestion: Western India, 256. Compare Pottinger&#8217;s (Travels in Baluchist&#225;n, 81) identification of the Jeths of Kacch-Gandevi north of Khelat with J&#225;ts or Jits.</note> According to the bards the name of the K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a tribe Jethva is derived from Jetha No. 85 or No. 95 of the Porbandar list, who was probably so called because he was born under the <corr sic="Jyesh&#7789;h&#803;a">Jyesh&#7789;ha</corr> constellation.<note id="n145.4" n="4">Tod&#8217;s Western India, 413.</note> The common practice of explaining a tribal name by inventing some name-giving chief deprives this derivation of most of its probability.<note id="n145.5" n="5">Compare B&#252;hler in Epigraphia Indica, I. 294. Like the Ch&#225;lukyas and other tribes the Jethv&#225;s trace the name Jethva to a name-giving chief. Of the Jethv&#225;s Tod says (Annals of Rajasth&#225;n, I. 114): The Jethv&#225;s have all the appearance of Skythian descent. As they make no pretension to belong to any of the old Indian races they may be a branch of Skythians. In his Western India (page 412), though confused by his identification of &#346;&#225;nkha-dw&#225;ra with Sakotra instead of with Bet-Dw&#225;rka (compare K&#225;th. Gaz. 619), Tod still holds to a northern origin of the Jethv&#225;s.</note> In the present case it may further be noticed that the name Jethi is borne by two of the chiefs earlier than the Jetha referred to.<note id="n145.6" n="6">Nos. 6 and 82 of Colonel Watson&#8217;s List, K&#225;thi&#225;w&#225;r Gazetteer, 621.

These Ch&#225;vo&#7789;akas can be no other than the Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s of Pa&#241;ch&#225;sar on the borders of Kacch. The Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s of Pa&#241;ch&#225;sar do not appear to have been important rulers. At the most they seem to have held Vadhi&#225;r and part of the north coast of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a. Whatever be the origin of the name Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;, which was afterwards Sanskritised into the highsounding Ch&#225;po&#7789;ka&#7789;a or Strongbow, it does not seem to be the name of any great dynasty. The name very closely resembles the Gujar&#225;ti Chor (Prakrit Chau&#7789;&#225; or Chora&#7789;&#225;) meaning thieves or robbers; and J&#225;vad&#225;, which is a further corruption of Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;, is the word now in use in those parts for a thief or robber. Except the mention of the Ch&#225;vo&#7789;akas in the Navs&#225;r&#237; copperplate we do not find the Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s noticed in any known cotemporary Gujar&#225;t copperplates. For this reason it seems fair to regard them as unimportant rulers over a territory extending from Pa&#241;ch&#225;sar to A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Jaya&#347;ekhara, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;696.</note>The author of the Ratnam&#225;l&#225; (<hi rend="sc">C.</hi> 1230 <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>) says that in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;696 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 752) Jaya&#347;ekhara the Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225; king of Pa&#241;ch&#225;sar was attacked by the Chaulukya king Bhuva&#7693;a of Kaly&#225;naka&#7789;aka in Kany&#225;kubja or Kanoj and slain by Bhuva&#7693;a in battle. Before his death Jaya&#347;ekhara, finding his affairs hopeless, sent his pregnant wife Rupasundar&#237; to the forest in charge of her brother Surap&#225;la, one of his chief warriors. After Jaya&#347;ekhara&#8217;s death Rupasundar&#237; gave birth to a son named Vanar&#225;ja who became the illustrious founder of A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a. It is hard to say how much truth underlies this tradition. In the seventh century not Chaulukya but P&#225;la kings flourished in Kanoj. No place of importance called Kaly&#225;naka&#7789;aka is recorded in the Kanoj territory. And though there was a southern Ch&#225;lukya kingdom with its capital at Kaly&#225;n, its establishment at Kaly&#225;n was about the middle of the eleventh not in the seventh century. Further the known Dakhan Ch&#225;lukya lists contain no king named Bhuva&#7693;a, unless he be the great Ch&#225;lukya king Vijay&#225;ditya (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;696&#8211;733) also called Bhuvan&#225;sraya, who warred in the north and was there imprisoned but made his escape. The inference is that the author of the Ratnam&#225;l&#225;, knowing the Solan&#775;kis originally belonged to a city called Kaly&#225;n, and knowing that a Ch&#225;lukya king named Bhuva&#7693;a had defeated the Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s may have called Bhuva&#7693;a king of Kaly&#225;nka&#7789;aka and identified Kaly&#225;nka&#7789;aka with a country so well known to <corr sic="Pur&#225;nik">Pur&#225;&#7751;ic</corr> fame as Kany&#225;kubja. This view is supported by the absence in the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i and other old records of any mention of an invasion from Kanoj. It is possible that in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;696 some king Bhuva&#7693;a of the Gujar&#225;t <corr sic="Ch&#225;luky&#225;s">Ch&#225;lukyas</corr>, of whom at this time branches were ruling as far north as Kaira,<note id="n150.1" n="1">See above page <ref type="pageref" target="pb108">108</ref>.</note> invaded the Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s under Jaya&#347;ekhara.

Merutu&#7751;ga the author of the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i tells how Rupasundar&#237; was living in the forest swinging her son in a hammock, when a Jain priest named &#346;&#237;lagu&#7751;as&#250;ri noticing as he passed royal marks on the boy bought him from his mother. The story adds that a nun named V&#237;ramat&#237; brought up the boy whom the <hi>s&#225;dhu</hi> called Vanar&#225;ja or the forest king. When eight years old, the priest employed Vanar&#225;ja to protect his place of worship from rats. The boy&#8217;s skill in shooting rats convinced the priest he was not fit to be a <hi>s&#225;dhu</hi> but was worthy of a kingdom. He therefore returned the boy to his mother. These details seem invented by the Jains in their own honour. No mention of any such story occurs in the Ratnam&#225;l&#225;.<note id="n151.1" n="1">In the Satyapurakalpa of his T&#237;rth&#225;kalpa, Jinaprabhas&#250;ri tells an almost identical story of another king.</note>

 </p><p><note place="margin">Vanar&#225;ja, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;720&#8211;780 (?).</note>In the forests where Vanar&#225;ja passed his youth lived his maternal uncle Surap&#225;la, one of Jaya&#347;ekhara&#8217;s generals, who, after his sovereign&#8217;s defeat and death, had become an outlaw. Vanar&#225;ja grew up under Surap&#225;la&#8217;s charge. The Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i records the following story of the origin of Vanar&#225;ja&#8217;s wealth. A Kany&#225;kubja king married Mah&#225;&#7751;ak&#225; the daughter of a Gujar&#225;t king. To receive the proceeds of the marriage cess which the Gujar&#225;t king had levied from his subjects, a deputation or <hi>panchk&#250;la</hi> came from Kany&#225;kubja to Gujar&#225;t. The deputation made Vanar&#225;ja their leader or <hi>sellabhrit</hi> to realize the proceeds of the cess. In six months Vanar&#225;ja collected 24 <hi>l&#225;khs</hi> of <hi>P&#225;ruttha drammas</hi><note id="n151.2" n="2">This name often recurs in Jain works. These would seem to be Kshatrapa coins as Gadhaiya coins are simply called <hi>drammas</hi>.</note> and 4000 horse, which the deputation took and started for Kany&#225;kubja. Vanar&#225;ja waylaid and killed them, secured the money and horses, and remained in hiding for a year. With the wealth thus acquired Vanar&#225;ja enrolled an army and established his power assuming the title of king. <note place="margin">Founding of A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;746&#8211;765.</note>He fixed the site of a capital which afterwards rose to be the great city of A&#7751;ahilapura. The story of the choice of the site is the usual story of a hunted hare turning on the hounds showing the place to be the special nurse of strength and courage. Vanar&#225;ja is said to have asked a Bharv&#225;&#7693; or Shepherd named A&#7751;ahila son of &#346;&#225;khad&#225; to show him the best site. A&#7751;ahila agreed on condition that the city should be called by his name. A&#7751;ahila accordingly showed Vanar&#225;ja the place where a hare had attacked and chased a dog. Though much in this tradition is fabulous the city may have been called after some local chief since it was popularly known as A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a (Sk. A&#7751;ahilav&#225;ta) that is the place of A&#7751;ahila. In the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i Merutu&#7751;ga gives <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;746 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 802) as the date of the installation of Vanar&#225;ja, while in his <corr sic="Vich&#225;ra&#347;reni">Vich&#225;ra&#347;re&#7751;i</corr> the same author gives <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;765 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 821 Vaisakha &#346;ukla 2) as the date of the foundation of the city. The discrepancy may be explained by taking <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;746 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 802) to refer to the date of Vanar&#225;ja&#8217;s getting money enough to fix the site of his capital, and <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;765 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 821) to refer to the date of his installation in the completed A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a. Local tradition connects the date <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;746 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 802) with an image of Ganpati which is said to be as old as the establishment of the city and <pb id="pb152" n="152"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter I.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The <corr sic="Ch&#225;vad&#225;s">Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s</corr>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;720&#8211;956.</hi></item><item>Founding of A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;746&#8211;765.</item></list> </fw>to bear the date 802. But as the letters of the inscription on the image can be made out by ordinary readers they cannot have been inscribed at nearly so early a date as 802. <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;765 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 821), the year given in the <corr sic="Vich&#225;ra&#347;reni">Vich&#225;ra&#347;re&#7751;i</corr>, seems the more probable date for the installation as the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i says that Vanar&#225;ja got himself installed at A&#7751;ahilapura when he was about fifty.<note id="n152.1" n="1">The text is <corr sic="&#8216;">&#8220;</corr>Pa&#241;ch&#225;&#347;atavarshadesyah&#803;.&#8221;</note> This accords with the date fixed on other grounds. Placing Vanar&#225;ja&#8217;s birth at about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;720 would make him 44 in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;765 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 821) the date at which according to the Vich&#225;ra&#347;re&#7751;i he was formally installed as sovereign of A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a. Merutu&#7751;ga in both his works gives the length of Vanar&#225;ja&#8217;s life at 109 and of his reign at sixty years. The figure 60 seems to mark the length of his life and not of his reign. So long a reign as sixty years is barely possible for a sovereign who succeeded late in life, and the 109 years of his life can hardly be correct. Taking Vanar&#225;ja&#8217;s age at 45 when he was installed in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;765 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 821) and allowing fifteen years more to complete the sixty years <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;780 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 836) would be the closing year of his reign.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Vanar&#225;ja&#8217;s Installation.</note>The Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i narrates how generously Vanar&#225;ja rewarded those who had helped him in his adversity. His installation was performed by a woman named &#346;r&#237; Dev&#237; of K&#225;kara village whom in fulfilment of an early promise Vanar&#225;ja had taken to be his sister.<note id="n152.2" n="2">Probably K&#225;krej famous for its bullocks.</note> The story regarding the promise is that once when Vanar&#225;ja had gone with his uncle on a thieving expedition to K&#225;kara village and had broken into the house of a merchant he by mistake dipped his hand into a pot of curds. As to touch curds is the same as to dine at a house as a guest, Vanar&#225;ja left the house without taking anything from it.<note id="n152.3" n="3">Stories of thieves refraining from plundering houses where they have accidentally laid their hands on salt or millet are common.</note> Hearing what had happened the merchant&#8217;s sister invited Vanar&#225;ja as a brother to dinner and gave him clothes. In return Vanar&#225;ja promised if he ever regained his father&#8217;s kingdom he should receive his installation as king at her hands.<note id="n152.4" n="4">The making of the installation mark on the forehead is the privilege of the king&#8217;s sister who gives a blessing and receives a present of villages.</note> Vanar&#225;ja chose as minister a Bania named J&#225;mba. The story is that while Vanar&#225;ja was looting with two others he came across a merchant J&#225;mba who had five arrows. Seeing only three enemies, J&#225;mba broke and threw away two of the arrows, shouting &#8216;One for each of you.&#8217; Vanar&#225;ja admiring his coolness persuaded J&#225;mba to join his band and found him so useful that he promised to make him minister. From the absence of any reference to him in these and similar tales it is probable that his uncle Surap&#225;la died before the installing of Vanar&#225;ja. Vanar&#225;ja is said to have built at A&#7751;ahilv&#225;&#7693;a a Jain temple of Pa&#241;ch&#225;sar&#225; P&#225;rasn&#225;th so called because the image was brought from the old settlement of Pa&#241;ch&#225;sar. Mention of this temple continues during the Solan&#775;ki and V&#225;ghel&#225; times.

 </p><p><note place="margin">His Image.</note>Vanar&#225;ja is said to have placed a bowing image of himself facing the image of P&#225;rasn&#225;th.

Besides the earrings he is adorned with bracelets armlets and anklets and a large ornament hangs across the chest from the left shoulder to the right hip. The right hand is held near the chest in the act of granting protection: and the left hand holds something which cannot be made out. By his side is the umbrella-bearer and five other attendants. The statue closely resembles the lifesize figure of a king of the Solan&#775;ki period lying in the yard of a temple at M&#225;li&#225; about twenty-four miles north of Soman&#225;tha Patan. At Soman&#225;tha Patan are similar but less rich cotemporary figures of local officers of the Solan&#775;kis. Another similar figure of which only the torso remains is the statue of Anr&#225;ja the father of Vastup&#225;la in a niche in Vastup&#225;la&#8217;s temple at Girn&#225;r. The details of this figure belong to the Solan&#775;ki period.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Vanar&#225;ja&#8217;s Successors, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;780&#8211;961.</note>The lists of Vanar&#225;ja&#8217;s successors vary so greatly in the names, in the order of succession, and in the lengths of reigns, that little trust can be placed in them. The first three agree in giving a duration of 196 years to the <corr sic="Ch&#225;va&#7693;a">Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;</corr> dynasty after the accession of Vanar&#225;ja. The accession of the Solan&#775;ki founder M&#250;lar&#225;ja is given in the Vich&#225;ra&#347;re&#7751;i at Sam&#803;vat 1017 and in the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i at Sam&#803;vat 998 corresponding with the original difference of nineteen years (<abbr>S.</abbr> 802 and 821) in the founding of the city. This shows that though the total duration of the dynasty was traditionally known to be 196 years the order of succession was not known and guesses were made as to the duration of the different reigns. Certain dates fixed by inscriptions or otherwise known to some compilers and not known to others caused many discrepancies in the various accounts.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Yogar&#225;ja, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;806&#8211;841.</note>According to the calculations given above Vanar&#225;ja&#8217;s reign lasted to about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;780. Authorities agree that Vanar&#225;ja was succeeded by his son Yogar&#225;ja. The length of Yogar&#225;ja&#8217;s reign is given as thirty-five years by the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i and the Ratnam&#225;l&#225;, and as twenty-nine by the Vich&#225;ra&#347;re&#7751;i.

On the whole the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i date <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;841 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 897) seems the more probable. The author of the Vich&#225;ra&#347;re&#7751;i may have mistaken the <f>7</f> of the manuscripts for a <f>1</f>, the two figures in the manuscripts of that date being closely alike.

Kshemar&#225;ja one of Yogar&#225;ja&#8217;s three sons reported that several ships were storm-stayed at Prabh&#225;sa or Soman&#225;tha. The ships had 10,000 horses, many elephants, and millions of money and treasure. Kshemar&#225;ja prayed that he might seize the treasure. Yogar&#225;ja forbad him. In spite of their father&#8217;s orders the sons seized the treasure and brought it to the king. Yogar&#225;ja said nothing. And when the people asked him why he was silent he answered: To say I approve would be a sin; to say I do not approve would annoy you. Hitherto on account of an ancestor&#8217;s misdeeds we have been laughed at as a nation of thieves. Our name was improving and we were rising to the rank of true kings. This act of my sons has renewed the old stain. Yogar&#225;ja would not be comforted and mounted the funeral pyre.

The relationship of Yogar&#225;ja to Ratn&#225;ditya and Vairisim&#803;ha is not given.

It is probable that the reigns of the three brothers lasted altogether for thirty-nine years, fourteen years for the two elder brothers and twenty-five years for Kshemar&#225;ja the period mentioned by the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i.

 </p><p>[The period of Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225; rule at A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a is likely to remain obscure until the discovery of cotemporary inscriptions throws more light upon it than can be gathered from the confused and contradictory legends collected by the Solan&#775;ki historians, none of whom are older than the twelfth century. For the present a few points only can be regarded as established:

 </p><p>(i) The Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s, Ch&#225;vo&#7789;akas, or Ch&#225;potka&#7789;as, are connected with the Ch&#225;pas of Bh&#237;nm&#225;l and of Vadhv&#225;n and are therefore of Gurjjara race. (Compare <abbr expan="Indian Antiquary">Ind. Ant.</abbr> XVII. 192.)

 </p><p>(ii) They probably were never more than feudatories of the Bh&#237;nm&#225;l kings.

 </p><p>(iii) Though the legend places the fall of Pa&#241;ch&#225;sar in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;696 and the foundation of <corr sic="Anahilav&#225;&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a</corr> in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;746, the grant of Pulake&#347;i Jan&#225;&#347;raya shows that a Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225; (Ch&#225;vo&#7789;aka) kingdom existed in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;728.

 </p><p>As regards the chronology of the dynasty, the explanation of the long life of 110 years ascribed to Vanar&#225;ja may be that a grandson of the same name succeeded the founder of the family. The name of Ch&#225;mu&#7751;&#7693;a has, as Dr. B&#252;hler long ago pointed out, crept in through some error from the Solan&#775;ki list. But when the same author in two different works gives such contradictory lists and dates as Merutu&#7751;ga does in his Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i and his <corr sic="Vichara&#347;reni">Vich&#225;ra&#347;re&#7751;i</corr>, it is clearly useless to attempt to extract a consistent story from the chroniclers.&#8212;A.

The earliest writer on the Solan&#775;kis, the learned Jain priest Hemachandra (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1089&#8211;1173), in his work called the Dvy&#225;&#347;raya, has given a fairly full and correct account of the dynasty up to Siddhar&#225;ja (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1143). The work is said to have been begun by Hemachandra about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1160, and to have been finished and revised by another Jain monk named Abhayatilakaga&#7751;i in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1255.<note id="n156.1" n="1"><abbr>Ind.

This work is a grammar rather than a chronicle, still, though it has little reference to dates, it is a good collection of tales and descriptions. For chronology the best guide is the Vich&#225;ra&#347;re&#7751;i which its author has taken pains to make the chief authority in dates. The Vich&#225;ra&#347;re&#7751;i was written by Merutu&#7751;ga about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1314, some time after he wrote the <corr sic="Prabandhachintama&#7751;i">Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i</corr>.

 </p><p><note place="margin">The Name Chaulukya.</note>According to the Vich&#225;ra&#347;re&#7751;i after the Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s, in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;961 (Vaishakh Suddha 1017), began the reign of M&#250;lar&#225;ja the son of a daughter of the last Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225; ruler. The name Chaulukya is a Sanskritised form, through an earlier form Ch&#225;lukya, of the old names Chalkya, Chalikya, Chir&#238;kya, Ch&#225;lukya of the great Dakhan dynasty (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;552&#8211;973), made to harmonise with the <corr sic="Pur&#225;nik-looking">Pur&#225;&#7751;ic-looking</corr> story that the founder of the dynasty sprang from the palm or <hi>chuluka</hi> of Brahma. The form Chaulukya seems to have been confined to authors and writers. It was used by the great Dakhan poet Bilha&#7751;a (c. 1050 <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>) and by the A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a chroniclers. In Gujar&#225;t the popular form of the word seems to have been Solaki or Solan&#775;ki (a dialectic variant of Chalukya), a name till lately used by Gujar&#225;t bards. The sameness of name seems to show the Dakhan and Gujar&#225;t dynasties to be branches of one stock. No materials are available to trace the original seat of the family or to show when and whence they came to Gujar&#225;t. The balance of probability is, as Dr. B&#252;hler holds, that M&#250;lar&#225;ja&#8217;s ancestors came from the north.<note id="n156.2" n="2"><abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> VI. 180ff. The suggestion may be offered that the Kany&#225;kubja which is mentioned as the seat of M&#250;lar&#225;ja&#8217;s ancestors, is Kar&#7751;akubja, an old name of Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h.

 </p><p><note place="margin">M&#250;lar&#225;ja, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;961&#8211;996.</note>The Suk&#7771;itasank&#237;rtana says that the last Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225; king Bh&#250;bha&#7789;a was succeeded by his sister&#8217;s son M&#250;lar&#225;ja. Of the family or country of M&#250;lar&#225;ja&#8217;s father no details are given.

In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;930 of the family of Bhuiya&#7693;a (who destroyed Jaya&#347;ekhara) were three brothers R&#225;ji, Bija, and Da&#7751;&#7693;aka, who stopped at A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a on their way back from a pilgrimage to Soman&#225;tha in the guise of K&#225;rpa&#7789;ika or K&#225;pdi beggars. The three brothers attended a cavalry <pb id="pb157" n="157"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter II.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Chaulukyas, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;961&#8211;1242.</hi></item><item>M&#250;lar&#225;ja, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;961&#8211;996.</item></list> </fw>parade held by king S&#225;mantasim&#803;ha. An objection taken by R&#225;ji to some of the cavalry movements pleased S&#225;mantasim&#803;ha, who, taking him to be the scion of some noble family, gave him his sister L&#237;l&#225;dev&#237; in marriage. L&#237;l&#225;dev&#237; died pregnant and the child, which was taken alive from its dead mother&#8217;s womb was called M&#250;lar&#225;ja, because the operation was performed when the M&#250;la constellation was in power. M&#250;lar&#225;ja grew into an able and popular prince and helped to extend the kingdom of his maternal uncle. In a fit of intoxication S&#225;mantasim&#803;ha ordered M&#250;lar&#225;ja to be placed on the throne. He afterwards cancelled the grant. But M&#250;lar&#225;ja contended that a king once installed could not be degraded. He collected troops defeated and slew his uncle and succeeded to the throne in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;942 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 998). The main facts of this tale, that M&#250;lar&#225;ja&#8217;s father was one R&#225;ji of the Ch&#225;lukya family, that his mother was a Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;. princess, and that he came to the Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225; throne by killing his maternal uncle, appear to be true. That M&#250;lar&#225;ja&#8217;s father&#8217;s name was R&#225;ji is proved by Dr. B&#252;hler&#8217;s copperplate of M&#250;lar&#225;ja.<note id="n157.1" n="1"><abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> VI. 191ff.</note> Merutun&#775;ga&#8217;s details that R&#225;ji came in disguise to A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a, took the fancy of S&#225;mantasim&#803;ha, and received his sister in marriage seem fictions in the style common in the bardic praises of R&#225;jput princes. Dr. B&#252;hler&#8217;s copperplate further disproves the story as it calls M&#250;lar&#225;ja the son of the illustrious R&#225;ji, the great king of kings <hi>Mah&#225;r&#225;j&#225;dhir&#225;ja</hi>, a title which would not be given to a wandering prince. R&#225;ji appears to have been of almost equal rank with the Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s. The Ratnam&#225;l&#225; calls R&#225;ji fifth in descent from Bhuva&#7693;a, his four predecessors being Kar&#7751;&#225;ditya, Ch&#225;ndr&#225;ditya, Som&#225;ditya, and Bhuvan&#225;ditya. But the Ratnam&#225;l&#225; list is on the face of it wrong, as it gives five instead of seven or eight kings to fill the space of over 200 years between Jaya&#347;ekhara and M&#250;lar&#225;ja.

 </p><p>Most Jain chroniclers begin the history of A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a with M&#250;lar&#225;ja who with the Jains is the glory of the dynasty. After taking the small Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225; kingdom M&#250;lar&#225;ja spread his power in all directions, overrunning K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a and Kacch on the west, and fighting B&#225;rappa of L&#225;&#7789;a or South Gujar&#225;t on the south, and Vigrahar&#225;ja king of Ajmir on the north. The Ajmir kings were called Sap&#225;dalaksha. Why they were so called is not known. This much is certain that Sap&#225;dalaksha is the Sanskrit form of the modern Sew&#225;lik. It would seem that the Choh&#225;ns, whom the Gujar&#225;t Jain chroniclers call Sap&#225;dalaksh&#237;ya, must have come to Gujar&#225;t from the Sew&#225;lik hills. After leaving the Sew&#225;lik hills the capital was at Ajmir, which is usually said to have been first fortified by the Choh&#225;n king Ajayap&#225;la (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1174&#8211;1177).<note id="n157.2" n="2">Kirtane&#8217;s Hamm&#237;ramah&#225;k&#225;vya, I.</note> This story seems invented by the Choh&#225;ns. The name Ajmir appears to be derived from the Mehrs who were in power in these parts between the fifth and the eighth centuries.

At the close of the rains the Sap&#225;dalaksha king fixed his camp near a place called &#346;&#225;kambhar&#237; and bringing the goddess &#346;&#225;kambhar&#237; there held the Nine-Night festival. This device disappointed M&#250;lar&#225;ja. He sent for his <hi>s&#225;mantas</hi> or nobles and gave them presents. He told them his plans and called on them to support him in attacking the Sap&#225;dalaksha king. M&#250;lar&#225;ja then mounted a female elephant with no attendant but the driver and in the evening came suddenly to the Ajmir camp. He dismounted and holding a drawn sword in his hand said to the doorkeeper &#8216;What is your king doing. Go and tell your lord that M&#250;lar&#225;ja waits at his door.&#8217; While the attendant was on his way to give the message, M&#250;lar&#225;ja pushed him on one side and himself went into the presence. The doorkeeper called &#8216;Here comes M&#250;lar&#225;ja.&#8217; Before he could be stopped M&#250;lar&#225;ja forced his way in and took his seat on the throne. The Ajmir king in consternation asked &#8216;Are you M&#250;lar&#225;ja?&#8217; M&#250;lar&#225;ja answered &#8216;I would regard him as a brave king who would meet me face to face in battle. While I was thinking no such brave enemy exists, you have arrived. I ask no better fortune than to fight with you. But as soon as you are come, like a bee falling in at dinner time, B&#225;rappa the general of king Tailapa of Telingana has arrived to attack me. While I am punishing him you should keep quiet and not give me a side blow.&#8217; The Ajmir king said, &#8216;Though you are a king, you have come here alone like a foot soldier, not caring for your safety. I will be your ally for life.&#8217; M&#250;lar&#225;ja replied &#8216;Say not so.&#8217; He refused the R&#225;ja&#8217;s invitation to dine, and leaving sword in hand mounted his elephant and with his nobles attacked the camp of B&#225;rappa. B&#225;rappa was killed and eighteen of his elephants and 10,000 of his horses fell into M&#250;lar&#225;ja&#8217;s hands. While returning with the spoil M&#250;lar&#225;ja received news that the Sap&#225;dalaksha king had fled.

The truth seems to be that the Ajm&#237;r king defeated M&#250;lar&#225;ja and on M&#250;lar&#225;ja&#8217;s submission did not press his advantage. In these circumstances M&#250;lar&#225;ja&#8217;s victory over B&#225;rappa seems improbable. The Dvy&#225;&#347;raya devotes seventy-five verses (27&#8211;101) of its sixth chapter to the contest between B&#225;rappa and M&#250;lar&#225;ja. The details may be thus summarised. Once when M&#250;lar&#225;ja received presents from various Indian kings Dv&#225;rappa<note id="n159.1" n="1">Apparently a Sanskrit form of B&#225;rappa.</note> king of L&#225;&#7789;ade&#347;a sent an ill-omened elephant. The marks being examined by royal officers and by prince Ch&#225;mu&#7751;&#7693;a, they decided the elephant would bring destruction on the king who kept him. The elephant was sent back in disgrace and M&#250;lar&#225;ja and his son started with an army to attack L&#225;&#7789;ade&#347;a and avenge the insult. In his march M&#250;lar&#225;ja first came to the &#346;vabhravat&#237; or S&#225;barmat&#237; which formed the boundary of his kingdom, frightening the people. From the S&#225;barmat&#237; he advanced to the ancient Pur&#237;<note id="n159.2" n="2">Broach according to the commentator.</note> where also the people became confused. The L&#225;&#7789;a king prepared for fight, and was slain by <corr sic="Ch&#225;mun&#7693;a">Ch&#225;mu&#7751;&#7693;a</corr> in single combat. M&#250;lar&#225;ja advanced to Broach where B&#225;rappa who was assisted by the island kings opposed him. Ch&#225;mu&#7751;&#7693;a overcame them and slew B&#225;rappa. After this success M&#250;lar&#225;ja and Ch&#225;mu&#7751;&#7693;a returned to A&#7751;ahilapura.<note id="n159.3" n="3">The Suk&#7771;itasank&#237;rtana mentions this defeat of B&#225;rappa who is said to be a general of the Kany&#225;kubja or Kanoj king. The Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i (M&#250;lar&#225;japrabandha) also mentions the invasion and slaughter of B&#225;rappa; but there is no reference to it in the grant of B&#225;rappa&#8217;s descendant Trilochanap&#225;la (<abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> XII. 196ff.)</note>

 </p><p>The Dvy&#225;&#347;raya styles B&#225;rappa king of L&#225;&#7789;ade&#347;a; the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i calls him a general of Tailapa king of Teling&#225;na; the Suk&#7771;itasank&#237;rtana a general of the Kany&#225;kubja king; and the K&#237;rtikaumud&#237;<note id="n159.4" n="4">Canto II. Verse 3.</note> a general of the Lord of L&#225;&#7789;a.

 </p><p>Other evidence proves that at the time of M&#250;lar&#225;ja a Chaulukya king named B&#225;rappa did reign in L&#225;&#7789;ade&#347;a. The Surat grant of K&#237;rtir&#225;ja grandson of B&#225;rappa is dated <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1018 (&#346;aka 940). This, taking twenty years to a king, brings B&#225;rappa&#8217;s date to <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;978 (&#346;aka 900), a year which falls in the reign of M&#250;lar&#225;ja (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;961&#8211;996; &#346;. 1027&#8211;1053). The statement in the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i that B&#225;rappa was a general of Tailapa seems correct. The southern form of the name B&#225;rappa supports the statement. And as Tailapa overthrew the R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;972 (&#346;aka 894) he might well place a general in military charge of L&#225;&#7789;a, and allow him practical independence. This would explain why the Dvy&#225;&#347;raya calls B&#225;rappa king of L&#225;&#7789;ade&#347;a and why the K&#237;rtikaumud&#237; calls him general of the Lord of L&#225;&#7789;a.

 </p><p>One of M&#250;lar&#225;ja&#8217;s earliest wars was with Graharipu the &#193;bh&#237;ra or <corr sic="Chu&#7693;&#225;sam&#225;">Ch&#250;&#7693;&#225;sam&#225;</corr> ruler of Sorath.<note id="n159.5" n="5">As Mr. Forbes rightly observed Graharipu the Planet-seizer is a made-up title based on the resemblance of the planet-seizer&#8217;s name R&#225;hu to R&#225; the title of the <corr sic="Chud&#225;sam&#225;s">Ch&#250;&#7693;&#225;sam&#225;s</corr> of Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h.

Graharipu&#8217;s capital was V&#225;manasthal&#237;, the modern Vanthal&#237; nine miles west of Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h, and the fort of Durgapalli which Graharipu is said to have established must be Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h itself which was not then a capital. Graharipu is described as a cow-eating Mlechha and a grievous tyrant. He is said to have had much influence over L&#225;kh&#225; son of king Phula of Kacch and to have been helped by Turks and other Mlechhas. When M&#250;lar&#225;ja reached the Jambum&#225;li river, he was met by Graharipu and his army. With Graharipu was L&#225;kh&#225; of Kacch, the king of Sindh probably a Sumr&#225;, Mew&#225;s Bhilas, and the sons of Graharipu&#8217;s wife N&#237;l&#237; who had been summoned from near the Bhadar river by a message in the Yavana language.<note id="n160.1" n="1">The mention of her name and of the language in which she wrote suggest something remarkable in the race and position of queen N&#237;l&#237;.</note> With M&#250;lar&#225;ja were the kings of &#346;il&#225;prastha,<note id="n160.2" n="2">Perhaps Sith&#225; in Jh&#225;l&#225;v&#225;&#7693;.</note> of M&#225;rw&#225;r, of K&#225;s&#237;, of Arbuda or Abu, and of &#346;r&#237;m&#225;la or Bh&#237;nm&#225;l. M&#250;lar&#225;ja had also his own younger brother Gang&#225;mah, his friend king Revat&#237;mitra, and Bhils. It is specially mentioned that in this expedition M&#250;lar&#225;ja received no help from the sons of his paternal uncles B&#237;ja and Dandaka. The fight ended in Graharipu being made prisoner by M&#250;lar&#225;ja, and in L&#225;kh&#225; being slain with a spear. After the victory M&#250;lar&#225;ja went to Prabh&#225;sa, worshipped the <hi>lin&#775;ga</hi>, and returned to <corr sic="Anahilav&#225;&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a</corr> with his army and 108 elephants.

 </p><p>According to the author of the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i L&#225;kh&#225; met his death in a different contest with M&#250;lar&#225;ja. L&#225;kh&#225; who is described as the son of Phulad&#225;, and K&#225;malat&#225; daughter of K&#237;rttir&#225;ja a Parm&#225;r king, is said to have been invincible because he was under the protection of king Ya&#347;ovarman of M&#225;lwa. He defeated M&#250;lar&#225;ja&#8217;s army eleven times. In a twelfth encounter M&#250;lar&#225;ja besieged L&#225;kh&#225; in Kapilakot, slew him in single combat, and trod on his flowing beard. Enraged at this insult to her dead son L&#225;kh&#225;&#8217;s mother called down on M&#250;lar&#225;ja&#8217;s descendants the curse of the spider poison that is of leprosy.<note id="n160.3" n="3">The same account appears in the Kum&#225;rap&#225;lacharita.</note>

 </p><p>Mr. Forbes, apparently from bardic sources, states that on his wife&#8217;s death R&#225;ji the father of M&#250;lar&#225;ja went to the temple of <corr sic="Vishnu">Vish&#7751;u</corr> at Dw&#225;rk&#225;. On his return he visited the court of L&#225;kh&#225; Phul&#225;ni and espoused L&#225;kh&#225;&#8217;s sister R&#225;y&#225;ji by whom he had a son named R&#225;kh&#225;ich. This marriage proved the ruin of R&#225;ji. In a dispute about precedence L&#225;kh&#225; slew R&#225;ji and many of his R&#225;jput followers, his wife R&#225;y&#225;ji becoming a Sat&#237;. B&#237;ja the uncle of M&#250;lar&#225;ja urged his nephew to avenge his father&#8217;s death and M&#250;lar&#225;ja was further incited against L&#225;kh&#225; because L&#225;kh&#225; harboured R&#225;kh&#225;ich the younger son of R&#225;ji at his court as a rival to M&#250;lar&#225;ja.

 </p><p>According to the Dvy&#225;&#347;raya, either from the rising power of his son or from repentance for his own rough acts, after Ch&#225;mu&#7751;&#7693;a&#8217;s victory over B&#225;rappa M&#250;lar&#225;ja installed him as ruler and devoted himself to religion and charity. According to the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i M&#250;lar&#225;ja built in A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a a Jain temple named M&#250;lavasatik&#225;. But as the Nandi <pb id="pb161" n="161"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter II.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Chaulukyas, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;961&#8211;1242.</hi></item><item>M&#250;lar&#225;ja, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;961&#8211;996.</item></list> </fw>symbol on his copperplate shows that M&#250;lar&#225;ja was a devoted &#346;aivite, it is possible that this temple was built by some Jain guild or community and named after the reigning chief.<note id="n161.1" n="1">Compare the Lakshm&#237;-Vih&#225;ra Jain temple in Jesalmir built by the Jain San&#775;gha and called after the reigning king Lakshma&#7751;a.</note> M&#250;lar&#225;ja built a Mah&#225;deva temple called M&#250;lasv&#225;mi in A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a, and, in honour of Soman&#225;tha, he built the temple of <corr sic="M&#250;le&#347;vara">Mule&#347;vara</corr> at Ma&#7751;&#7693;ali-nagara where he went at the bidding of the god.<note id="n161.2" n="2">Dr. B&#252;hler&#8217;s copperplate of M&#250;lar&#225;ja records a grant to this temple, said to be of M&#250;lan&#225;thadeva in Ma&#7751;&#7693;ali in the Vardhi zilla, apparently the modern M&#225;ndal near Pa&#241;ch&#225;sar in the Vadhi&#225;r province near Jhinjhuv&#225;&#7693;a. The grant is in Sam&#803;vat 1043 and is dated from A&#7751;ahilapura though the actual gift was made at &#346;r&#237;sthala or Sidhpur after bathing in the Sarasvat&#237; and worshipping the god of the Rudramah&#225;laya. The grant is of the village of Kamboika, the modern Kam&#803;boi near Modhera. <abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> VI. 192&#8211;193. The grant is said to have been written by a K&#225;yastha named K&#225;&#241;cha&#7751;a and ends with the words &#8220;of the illustrious M&#250;lar&#225;ja.&#8221;</note> He also built at A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a a temple of Mah&#225;deva called Tripurushapr&#225;s&#225;da on a site to which the tradition attaches that seeing M&#250;lar&#225;ja daily visiting the temple of M&#250;lan&#225;thadeva at Ma&#7751;&#7693;ali, <corr sic="Somanatha">Soman&#225;tha</corr> Mah&#225;deva being greatly pleased promised to bring the ocean to A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a. Soman&#225;tha came, and the ocean accompanying the god certain ponds became brackish. In honour of these salt pools M&#250;lar&#225;ja built the Tripurushapr&#225;s&#225;da. Looking for some one to place in charge of this temple, M&#250;lar&#225;ja heard of an ascetic named Ka&#7751;thadi at Siddhapura on the banks of the Sarasvat&#237; who used to fast every other day and on the intervening day lived on five morsels of food. M&#250;lar&#225;ja offered this sage the charge of the temple. The sage declined saying &#8216;Authority is the surest path to hell.&#8217; Eventually Vayajalladeva a disciple of the sage undertook the management on certain conditions. M&#250;lar&#225;ja passed most of his days at the holy shrine of Siddhapura, the modern Sidhpur on the Sarasvat&#237; about fifteen miles north-east of A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a. At Sidhpur M&#250;lar&#225;ja made many grants to Br&#225;hmans. Several branches of Gujar&#225;t Br&#225;hmans, Aud&#237;chyas &#346;r&#237;gau&#7693;as and Kanojias, trace their origin in Gujar&#225;t to an invitation from M&#250;lar&#225;ja to Siddhapura and the local <corr sic="Pur&#225;nas">Pur&#225;&#7751;as</corr> and M&#225;h&#225;tmyas confirm the story. As the term Aud&#237;chya means Northerner M&#250;lar&#225;ja may have invited Br&#225;hmans from some such holy place as Kurukshetra which the Aud&#237;chyas claim as their home. From Kany&#225;kubja in the Madhyade&#347;a between the Ganges and the Yamun&#225; another equally holy place the Kanoj&#237;as may have been invited. The &#346;r&#237; Gau&#7693;as appear to have come from Bengal and Tirhut. Gau&#7693;a and Tirhut Br&#225;hmans are noted T&#225;ntriks and Mantras&#225;stris a branch of learning for which both the people and the rulers of Gujar&#225;t have a great fondness. Grants of villages were made to these Br&#225;hmans. Sidhpur was given to the Aud&#237;chyas, Sim&#803;hapura or Sihor in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a to some other colony, and Stambhat&#237;rtha or Cambay to the &#346;r&#237; Gau&#7693;as. At Siddhapura M&#250;lar&#225;ja built the famous temple called the Rudramah&#225;laya or the great shrine of Rudra. According to tradition M&#250;lar&#225;ja did not complete the Rudramah&#225;laya and Siddhar&#225;ja finished it. In spite of this tradition it does not appear that M&#250;lar&#225;ja died leaving the great temple unfinished as a copperplate of <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;987 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1043) records that <pb id="pb162" n="162"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter II.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Chaulukyas, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;961&#8211;1242.</hi></item><item>M&#250;lar&#225;ja, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;961&#8211;996.</item></list> </fw>M&#250;lar&#225;ja made the grant after worshipping the god of the Rudramah&#225;laya on the occasion of a solar eclipse on the fifteenth of the dark half of M&#225;gha. It would seem therefore that M&#250;lar&#225;ja built one large Rudramah&#225;laya which Siddhar&#225;ja may have repaired or enlarged. M&#250;lar&#225;ja is said while still in health to have mounted the funeral pile, an act which some writers trace to remorse and others to unknown political reasons. The Vich&#225;ra&#347;re&#7751;i gives the length of M&#250;lar&#225;ja&#8217;s reign at thirty-five years <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;961&#8211;996 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1017&#8211;1052); the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i begins the reign at <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;942 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 998) and ends it at <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;997 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1053) that is a length of fifty-five years.<note id="n162.1" n="1">The difference between 1052 and 1053 is probably only a few months.</note> Of the two, thirty-five years seems the more probable, as, if the traditional accounts are correct, M&#250;lar&#225;ja can scarcely have been a young man when he overthrew his uncle&#8217;s power.

The author of the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i assigns him a reign of thirteen years. The author of the Dvy&#225;&#347;raya says that he had three sons Vallabha R&#225;ja, Durlabha R&#225;ja, and N&#225;ga R&#225;ja. According to one account Ch&#225;mu&#7751;&#7693;a installed Vallabha in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1010 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1066) and went on pilgrimage to Benares. On his passage through M&#225;lwa Mu&#241;ja the M&#225;lwa king carried off Ch&#225;mu&#7751;&#7693;a&#8217;s umbrella and other marks of royalty.<note id="n162.2" n="2">The fight with Mu&#241;ja must have taken place about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1011 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1067). As Ch&#225;mu&#7751;&#7693;a started just after installing Vallabha the beginning of the reign must be before <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;997 as Tailapa who fought with Mu&#241;ja died in that year. This is proved by a manuscript dated <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;994 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1050) which gives the reigning king as Mu&#241;ja. That Bhoja Mu&#241;ja&#8217;s successor was ruling in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1014 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1070) makes it probable that Mu&#241;ja&#8217;s reign extended to <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1011 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1067).</note> Ch&#225;mu&#7751;&#7693;a went on to Benares in the guise of a hermit. On his return he prayed his son to avenge the insult offered by the king of M&#225;lwa. Vallabha started with an army but died of small-pox. The author of the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i gives Ch&#225;mu&#7751;&#7693;a a reign of six months, while the author of the Vich&#225;ra&#347;re&#7751;i entirely drops his name and gives a reign of fourteen years to Vallabha made up of the thirteen years of Ch&#225;mu&#7751;&#7693;a and the six months of Vallabha. This seems to be a mistake. It would seem more correct, as is done in several copperplate lists, to omit Vallabha, since he must have reigned jointly with his father and his name is not wanted for purposes of succession. The Vich&#225;ra&#347;re&#7751;i and the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i agree in ending Vallabha&#8217;s reign in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1010 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1066). The author of the Dvy&#225;&#347;raya states that Ch&#225;mu&#7751;&#7693;a greatly lamenting the death of Vallabha installed Vallabha&#8217;s younger brother Durlabha, and himself retired to die at &#346;uklat&#237;rtha on the Narbad&#225;.

The kings of An&#775;ga, K&#225;s&#237;, Avant&#237;, Ched&#237;, Kuru, H&#250;&#7751;a, Mathur&#225;, Vindhya, and Andhra were also present.<note id="n163.1" n="1">This Svayam&#803;vara and the list of attendant and rival kings seem imaginary. The Nadol chiefship was not important enough to draw kings from the countries named.</note> The princess chose Durlabha and Mahendra gave his younger sister Lakshm&#237; to Durlabha&#8217;s brother N&#225;ga R&#225;ja. The princess&#8217; choice of Durlabha drew on him the enmity of certain of the other kings all of whom he defeated. The brothers then returned to A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a where Durlabha built a lake called Durlabhasarovara. The author of the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i says that Durlabha gave up the kingdom to his son (?) Bh&#237;ma.<note id="n163.2" n="2">The text has son but Bh&#237;ma was Durlabha&#8217;s nephew not his son.</note> He also states that Durlabha went on pilgrimage and was insulted on the way by Mu&#241;ja king of M&#225;lwa. This seems the same tale which the Dvy&#225;&#347;raya tells of Ch&#225;mu&#7751;&#7693;a. Since Mu&#241;ja cannot have been a cotemporary of Durlabha the Dvy&#225;&#347;raya&#8217;s account seems correct.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Bh&#237;ma I. <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1022&#8211;1064.</note>Durlabha was succeeded by his nephew Bh&#237;ma the son of Durlabha&#8217;s younger brother N&#225;ga R&#225;ja. The author of the Dvy&#225;&#347;raya says that Durlabha wishing to retire from the world offered the kingdom to his nephew Bh&#237;ma; that Bh&#237;ma declined in favour of his father N&#225;ga R&#225;ja; that N&#225;ga R&#225;ja refused; that Durlabha and N&#225;ga R&#225;ja persuaded Bh&#237;ma to take the government; and that after installing Bh&#237;ma the two brothers died together. Such a voluntary double death sounds unlikely unless the result was due to the machinations of Bh&#237;ma. The Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i gives Bh&#237;ma a reign of fifty-two years from <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1022 to 1074 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1078&#8211;1130), while the Vich&#225;ra&#347;re&#7751;i reduces his reign to forty-two years placing its close in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1064 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1120). Forty-two years would seem to be correct as another copy of the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i has 42.

 </p><p>Two copperplates of Bh&#237;ma are available one dated <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1030 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1086) eight or nine years after he came to the throne, the other from Kacch in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1037 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1093).

 </p><p>Bh&#237;ma seems to have been more powerful than either of his predecessors. According to the Dvy&#225;&#347;raya his two chief enemies were the kings of Sindh and of Ched&#237; or Bundelkhand. He led a victorious expedition against Hammuka the king of Sindh, who had conquered the king of Sivas&#225;na and another against Kar&#7751;a king of Ched&#237; who paid tribute and submitted. The Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i has a verse, apparently an old verse interpolated, which says that on the M&#225;lwa king Bhoja&#8217;s death, while sacking Dh&#225;r&#225;puri, Kar&#7751;a took Bh&#237;ma as his coadjutor, and that afterwards Bh&#237;ma&#8217;s general D&#225;mara took Kar&#7751;a captive and won from him a gold <hi>ma&#7751;&#7693;apik&#225;</hi> or canopy and images of Gane&#347;a and N&#237;laka&#7751;&#7789;he&#347;vara Mah&#225;deva. Bh&#237;ma is said to have presented the canopy to Soman&#225;tha.

 </p><p>When Bh&#237;ma was engaged against the king of Sindh, Kulachandra the general of the M&#225;lwa king Bhoja with all the M&#225;lwa feudatories, invaded A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a, sacked the city, and sowed shell-money at the gate where the time-marking gong was sounded. So great was the <pb id="pb164" n="164"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter II.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Chaulukyas, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;961&#8211;1242.</hi></item><item>Bh&#237;ma I. <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1022&#8211;1064.</item></list> </fw>loss that the &#8216;sacking of Kulachandra&#8217; has passed into a proverb. Kulachandra also took from A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a an acknowledgment of victory or <hi>jayapatra</hi>. On his return Bhoja received Kulachandra with honour but blamed him for not sowing salt instead of shell-money.<note id="n164.1" n="1">By sowing cowries Kulachandra may have meant to show the cheapness of A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a. Bhoja&#8217;s meaning was that as shells are money, to sow shells was to sow M&#225;lwa wealth in Gujar&#225;t. If Kulachandra had sown salt all would have melted, and no trace been left. [This seems a symbolic later-stage explanation. The sense seems to be shell-sowing keeps the A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a guardians in place since guardians can live in shells: salt-sowing scares the guardian spirits and makes the site of the city a haunt of demons. Bhoja saw that thanks to his general the Luck of A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a would remain safe in the shells.]</note> He said the shell-money is an omen that the wealth of M&#225;lwa will flow to Gujar&#225;t. An unpublished inscription of Bhoja&#8217;s successor Uday&#225;ditya in a temple at Udepur near Bhils&#225; confirms the above stating that Bh&#237;ma was conquered by Bhoja&#8217;s officers.<note id="n164.2" n="2">The Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i tells other stories of the relations between Bh&#237;ma and Bhoja. Once when Gujar&#225;t was suffering from famine Bh&#237;ma heard that Bhoja was coming with a force against Gujar&#225;t. Alarmed at the news Bh&#237;ma asked D&#225;mara his minister of peace and war to prevent Bhoja coming. D&#225;mara went to M&#225;lwa, amused the king by witty stories, and while a play was being acted in court degrading and joking other kings, something was said regarding Tailapa of Telingana. On this Damara reminded the king that the head of his grandfather Mu&#241;ja was fixed at Tailap&#8217;s door. Bhoja grew excited and started with an army against Telingana. Hearing that Bh&#237;ma had come against him as far as Bh&#237;mapura (?) Bhoja asked D&#225;mara to prevent Bh&#237;ma advancing further. D&#225;mara stopped Bh&#237;ma by taking him an elephant as a present from Bhoja. The <corr sic="Prabandachint&#225;ma&#7751;i">Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i</corr> gives numerous other stories showing that at times the relations between Bhoja and Bh&#237;ma were friendly.</note>

 </p><p>The Solan&#775;ki kings of A&#7751;ahilapura being &#346;aivites held the god Soman&#225;tha of Prabh&#225;sa in great veneration. The very ancient and holy shrine of Prabh&#225;sa has long been a place of special pilgrimage. As early as the Y&#225;davas of Dw&#225;rk&#225;,<note id="n164.3" n="3">See above page <ref type="pageref" target="pb9">9</ref>.</note> pilgrimages to Prabh&#225;sa are recorded but the Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata makes no mention either of Soman&#225;tha or of any other &#346;aivite shrine. The shrine of Soman&#225;tha was probably not established before the time of the Valabhis (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;480&#8211;767). As the Valabhi kings were most open-handed in religious gifts, it was probably through their grants that the Soman&#225;tha temple rose to importance. The Solan&#775;kis were not behind the Valabhis in devotion to Soman&#225;tha. To save pilgrims from oppression M&#250;lar&#225;ja fought Graharipu the &#193;bh&#237;ra king of Sorath.<note id="n164.4" n="4">See above page <ref type="pageref" target="pb160">160</ref>.</note> M&#250;lar&#225;ja afterwards went to Prabh&#225;sa and also built temples in Gujar&#225;t in honour of the god Soman&#225;tha. As M&#250;lar&#225;ja&#8217;s successors Ch&#225;mu&#7751;&#7693;a and Durlabha continued firm devotees of Soman&#225;tha during their reigns (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;997&#8211;1022) the wealth of the temple must have greatly increased.

This idol was the greatest of all the idols of Hind. At every eclipse<note id="n165.2" n="2">Since the earliest times Hindus have held eclipse days sacred. According to the <corr sic="Mahabh&#225;rata">Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata</corr> the Y&#225;davas of Dw&#225;rk&#225; came to Soman&#225;tha for an eclipse fair. Great fairs are still held at Soman&#225;tha on the K&#225;rtika and Chaitra (December and April) fullmoons.</note> the Hindus went on pilgrimage to the temple, and there congregated to the number of a hundred thousand persons. According to their doctrine of transmigration the Hindus believe that after separation from the body the souls of men meet at Soman&#225;tha; and that the ebb and flow of the tide is the worship paid to the best of its power by the sea to the idol.<note id="n165.3" n="3">This old Indian idea is expressed in a verse in an inscription in Soman&#225;tha P&#225;tan itself.</note> All that is most precious in India was brought to Soman&#225;tha. The temple attendants received the most valuable presents, and the temple was endowed with more than 10,000 villages.<note id="n165.4" n="4">Ten thousand must be taken vaguely.</note> In the temple were amassed jewels of the most exquisite quality and of incalculable value. The people of India have a great river called Ganga to which they pay the highest honour and into which they cast the bones of their great men, in the belief that the deceased will thus secure an entrance to heaven. Though between this river and Soman&#225;tha is a distance of about 1200 miles (200 <hi>parasangs</hi>) water was daily brought from it to wash the idol.<note id="n165.5" n="5">Compare Sachau&#8217;s Alberuni, II. 104. Every day they brought Soman&#225;tha a jug of Ganges water and a basket of Kashmir flowers. Soman&#225;tha they believed cured every inveterate sickness and healed every desperate and incurable disease. The reason why Soman&#225;tha became so famous was that it was a harbour for those who went to and fro from Sofala in Zanzibar to China. It is still the practice to carry Ganges water to bathe distant gods.</note> Every day a thousand Br&#225;hmans performed the worship and introduced visitors.<note id="n165.6" n="6">These must be the local Sompura Br&#225;hmans who still number more than five hundred souls in Soman&#225;tha Patan.</note> The shaving of the heads and beards of pilgrims employed three hundred barbers.<note id="n165.7" n="7">Shaving is the first rite performed by pilgrims.</note> Three hundred and fifty persons sang and danced at the gate of the temple,<note id="n165.8" n="8">Dancers are now chiefly found in the temples of Southern India.</note> every one receiving a settled daily allowance. When Mahm&#250;d was gaining victories and demolishing idols in North India, the Hindus said Soman&#225;tha is displeased with these idols. If Soman&#225;tha had been satisfied with them no one could have destroyed or injured them. When Mahm&#250;d heard this he resolved on making a campaign to destroy Soman&#225;tha, believing that when the Hindus saw their prayers and imprecations to be false and futile they would embrace the Faith.

 </p><p>So he prayed to the Almighty for aid, and with 30,000 horse besides volunteers left Ghazni on the 10th Sha&#8217;b&#225;n (H. 414, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1024). <pb id="pb166" n="166"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter II.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Chaulukyas, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;961&#8211;1242.</hi></item><item>Soman&#225;tha, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1024.</item></list> </fw>He took the road to Mult&#225;n and reached it in the middle of Ramz&#225;n. The road from Mult&#225;n to India lay through a barren desert without inhabitants or food. Mahm&#250;d collected provisions for the passage and loading 30,000 camels with water and corn started for A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a. After he had crossed the desert he perceived on one side a fort full of people in which place there were wells.<note id="n166.1" n="1">Mahm&#250;d seems to have crossed the desert from Mult&#225;n and Bah&#225;walpur to Bik&#225;n&#237;r and thence to Ajm&#237;r.</note> The leaders came to conciliate him, but he invested the place, and God gave him victory over it, for the hearts of the people failed them through fear. He brought the place under the sway of Isl&#225;m, killed the inhabitants, and broke in pieces their images. His men carrying water with them marched for A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a, where they arrived at the beginning of Z&#237;lk&#225;da.

 </p><p>The Chief of A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a, called Bh&#237;m, fled hastily, and abandoning his city went to a certain fort for safety and to prepare for war. Mahm&#250;d pushed on for Soman&#225;tha. On his march he came to several forts in which were many images serving as chamberlains or heralds of Soman&#225;tha. These Mahm&#250;d called Shait&#225;n or devils. He killed the people, destroyed the fortifications, broke the idols in pieces, and through a waterless desert marched to Soman&#225;tha. In the desert land he met 20,000 fighting men whose chiefs would not submit. He sent troops against them, defeated them, put them to flight, and plundered their possessions. From the desert he marched to Dabalw&#225;rah,<note id="n166.2" n="2">Apparently Delv&#225;da near Un&#225;.

Mahm&#250;d took the place, slew the men, plundered their property, and marched to Soman&#225;tha.

 </p><p>Reaching Soman&#225;tha on a Thursday in the middle of Z&#237;lk&#225;da Mahm&#250;d beheld a strong fortress built on the sea-shore, so that its walls were washed by the waves.<note id="n166.3" n="3">The waves still beat against the walls of the ruined fort of Soman&#225;tha.</note> From the walls the people jeered at the Musalm&#225;ns. Our deity, they said, will cut off the last man of you and destroy you all. On the morrow which was Friday the assailants advanced to the assault. When the Hindus saw how the Muhammadans fought they abandoned their posts and left the walls. The Musalm&#225;ns planted their ladders and scaled the walls. From the top they raised their war-cry, and showed the might of Isl&#225;m. Still their loss was so heavy that the issue seemed doubtful. A body of Hindus hurried to Soman&#225;tha, cast themselves on the ground before him, and besought him to grant them victory. Night came on and the fight was stayed.

 </p><p>Early next morning Mahm&#250;d renewed the battle. His men made greater havoc among the Hindus till they drove them from the town to the house of their idol Soman&#225;tha. At the gate of the temple the slaughter was dreadful. Band after band of the defenders entered the temple and standing before Soman&#225;tha with their hands clasped round their necks wept and passionately entreated him. Then they issued forth to fight and fought till they were slain.

 </p><p>The temple of Soman&#225;tha rested on fifty-six pillars of teakwood covered with lead.<note id="n167.1" n="1">This shows that the temple was a building of brick and wood. According to Alberuni (Sachau, II. 105) the temple was built about a hundred years before Mahm&#250;d&#8217;s invasion. An inscription at Patan states that Bh&#237;madeva I. (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1022&#8211;1072) rebuilt the Soman&#225;tha temple of stone. In Dr. Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l&#8217;s opinion the first dynasty in Gujar&#225;t to make stone buildings were the Solan&#775;kis. Before them buildings and temples were of wood and brick.</note> The idol was in a dark chamber. The height of the idol was five cubits and its girth three cubits. This was what appeared to the eye; two cubits were hidden in the basement. It had no appearance of being sculptured. Mahm&#250;d seized it, part of it he burnt, and part he carried with him to Ghazni, where he made it a step at the entrance of the Great Mosque.<note id="n167.2" n="2">Of the fate of the great Lin&#775;ga Alberuni (Sachau, II. 103) writes: Prince Mahm&#250;d ordered the upper part to be broken. The rest with all its coverings and trappings of gold jewels and embroidered garments he transported to Ghazni. Part of it together with the brass Chakravarti or <corr sic="Vishnu">Vish&#7751;u</corr> of Th&#225;nesvar has been thrown into the hippodrome of the town: part lies before the mosque for people to rub their feet on.</note> The dark shrine was lighted by exquisitely jewelled chandeliers. Near the idol was a chain of gold 200 <hi>mans</hi> in weight. To the chain bells were fastened. And when each watch of the night was over the chain was shaken and the ringing of the bells roused a fresh party of Br&#225;hmans to carry on the worship. In the treasury which was near the shrine were many idols of gold and silver. Among the treasures were veils set with jewels, every jewel of immense value. What was found in the temple was worth more than two millions of <hi>din&#225;rs</hi>. Over fifty thousand Hindus were slain.<note id="n167.3" n="3">The next paragraph relating to Mahm&#250;d&#8217;s return will be found on page 249 of the same volume of Sir H. Elliott&#8217;s work.</note>

 </p><p>After the capture of Soman&#225;tha, Mahm&#250;d received intelligence that Bh&#237;m the chief of A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a had gone to the fort of Khandahat,<note id="n167.4" n="4">Khandahat which must have been on the coast has not been identified. The description suggests some coast island in the gulf of Kacch. By the Girn&#225;r route forty <hi>parasangs</hi> that is 240 miles would reach the Kacch coast. Kanthkot in V&#225;gad in east Kacch suits well in sound and is known to have been a favourite resort of the Solan&#775;kis. But the ebb and flow of the tide close to it are difficult to explain. The identification with Kanthkot is favoured by Dr. B&#252;hler. Colonel Watson (K&#225;thi&#225;w&#225;r Gazetteer, 80) prefers G&#225;ndhvi on the <corr sic="K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;da">K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a</corr> coast a few miles north-east of Mi&#225;ni. M. Reinaud and Dr. Weil suggest Gandh&#225;r in Broach on the left bank of the mouth of the Dh&#225;dhar river. Sir H. Elliot (I. 445 and II. 473) prefers Khandad&#225;r at the north-west angle of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a.</note> about 240 miles (40 <hi>parasangs</hi>) from Soman&#225;tha between that place and the desert. Mahm&#250;d marched to Khandahat. When he came before it he questioned some men who were hunting as to the tide. He learned that the ford was practicable, but that if the wind blew a little the crossing was dangerous. Mahm&#250;d prayed to the Almighty and entered the water. He and his forces passed safely and drove out the enemy. From Khandahat he returned intending to proceed against Mans&#250;ra in central Sindh, whose ruler was an apostate Muhammadan. At the news of Mahm&#250;d&#8217;s approach the chief fled into the date forests. Mahm&#250;d followed, and surrounding him and his adherents, many of them were slain, many drowned, and few escaped. Mahm&#250;d then went <pb id="pb168" n="168"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter II.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Chaulukyas, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;961&#8211;1242.</hi></item><item>Soman&#225;tha, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1024.</item></list> </fw>to Bh&#225;ti&#225;, and after reducing the inhabitants to obedience, returned to Ghazni where he arrived on the 10th Safar 417 H. (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1026).

 </p><p>The Rauzatu-s-saf&#225; of Mirkhand supplements these details with the following account of Mahm&#250;d&#8217;s arrangements for holding Gujar&#225;t: &#8216;It is related that when <corr sic="Sultan">Sult&#225;n</corr> Mahm&#250;d had achieved the conquest of Soman&#225;tha he wished to fix his residence there for some years because the country was very extensive and possessed many advantages among them several mines which produced pure gold. Indian rubies were brought from Sarand&#237;p, one of the dependencies of the kingdom of Gujar&#225;t. His ministers represented to Mahm&#250;d that to forsake Khur&#225;s&#225;n which had been won from his enemies after so many battles and to make Soman&#225;tha the seat of government was very improper. At last the king made up his mind to return and ordered some one to be appointed to hold and carry on the administration of the country. The ministers observed that as it was impossible for a stranger to maintain possession he should assign the country to one of the native chiefs. The Sult&#225;n accordingly held a council to settle the nomination, in concurrence with such of the inhabitants as were well disposed towards him. Some of them represented to him that amongst the ancient royal families no house was so noble as that of the D&#225;bshil&#237;ms of whom only one member survived, and he had assumed the habit of a Br&#225;hman, and was devoted to philosophical pursuits and austerity.&#8217;<note id="n168.1" n="1">According to Ferishta (Bombay Persian Ed. I. 57, Briggs&#8217; Translation, I. 74) Mahm&#250;d stayed and meant to make his capital at A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a not at Soman&#225;tha. That Mahm&#250;d did stay at A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a the Martyr&#8217;s Mound and the Ghazni Mosque in Patan are evidence. Still the mound was probably raised and the mosque may at least have been begun in honour of the capture of A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a on the journey south. Traces of a second mosque which is said to have had a tablet recording Mahm&#250;d of Ghazni as the builder have recently (1878) been found at Munjpur about twenty-five miles south-east of R&#225;dhanpur.</note>

 </p><p>That Mahm&#250;d should have found it necessary to appoint some local chief to keep order in Gujar&#225;t is probable. It is also probable that he would choose some one hostile to the defeated king. It has been suggested above that Bh&#237;ma&#8217;s uncle Durlabha did not retire but was ousted by his nephew and that the story of Vallabha and Durlabha dying together pointed to some usurpation on the part of Bh&#237;ma. The phrase the D&#225;bshil&#237;ms seems to refer either to Durlabhasena or his son. Whoever was chosen must have lost his power soon after Mahm&#250;d&#8217;s departure.<note id="n168.2" n="2">Briggs&#8217; Ferishta, I. 75. This account of the D&#225;bshil&#237;ms reads more like a tradition than an historical record. It is to be noted that the authors both of the <corr sic="Ain-i-Akbar&#237;">&#193;in-i-Akbari</corr> (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1583) and of the Mirat-i-Ahmad&#237; (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1762) give Ch&#225;mu&#7751;&#7693;a as king at the time of Mahm&#250;d&#8217;s invasion. Their statements cannot weigh against Ibn As&#237;r&#8217;s account. Compare Dr. B&#252;hler&#8217;s remarks in <abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> VI. 184. Of Mahm&#250;d&#8217;s return to Ghazni (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1026) the <corr sic="Tabak&#225;t-i-Akbar&#237;">Tabak&#225;t-i-Akbari</corr> says: &#8216;When Mahm&#250;d resolved to return from Soman&#225;tha he learned that Parama Dev, one of the greatest R&#225;j&#225;s of Hindust&#225;n, was preparing to intercept him. The Sult&#225;n, not deeming it advisable to contend with this chief, went towards Mult&#225;n through Sindh. In this journey his men suffered much in some places from scarcity of water in others from want of forage. After enduring great difficulties he arrived at Ghazni in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1029 (H. 417).&#8217; This Parama Dev would seem to be the Parm&#225;ra king of &#193;bu who could well block the Ajmir-Gujar&#225;t route. The route taken by Mahm&#250;d must have passed by Mans&#250;ra near Br&#225;hman&#225;b&#225;d, Bh&#225;tia, and Mult&#225;n. It <pb/>must have been in the crossing of the great desert that he suffered so severely from scarcity of water and forage. Ferishta (Briggs, I. 75) says that many of Mahm&#250;d&#8217;s troops died raging mad from the intolerable heat and thirst. The historian Muhammad Ufi (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1200) alleges (Elliot, II. 192) that two Hindus disguised as countrymen offered themselves as guides and led the army three days&#8217; march out of the right course, where they were saved only by Mahm&#250;d&#8217;s miraculous discovery of a pool of sweet water. [This tale of the self-sacrificing Br&#225;hman or priest and the miraculous find of water has gathered round Mahm&#250;d as the latest of myth centres. It is Herodotus&#8217; (Book III. 154&#8211;158) old Zopyrus tale (Rawlinson&#8217;s Seventh Monarchy, 318); it is revived in honour of the Great Kush&#225;n Kanishka, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;78 (Beruni in Elliot, II. 11), of the Sassanian Firoz <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;457&#8211;483 (Rawlinson&#8217;s Seventh Monarchy, 318), and of a certain king of Z&#225;bulist&#225;n or Ghazni of uncertain date (Elliot II. 170). Similarly the puzzling Dabshil&#237;m tale seems to be peculiar neither to Gujar&#225;t nor to Mahm&#250;d of Ghazni. It seems a repetition of the tale of Dabshil&#237;m the man of the royal race, who, according to the Panchatantra or Fables of Pilpai, was chosen successor of Porus after Alexander the Great&#8217;s Viceroy had been driven out. [Compare Reinaud&#8217;s <foreign lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M&#233;moire Sur l&#8217;Inde</foreign>, 127&#8211;128.] The Tabak&#225;t-i-N&#225;sir&#237; (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1227) adds (Elliot, II. 475) that the guide devoted his life for the sake of Soman&#225;tha and this account is adopted by Ferishta, Briggs&#8217; Translation, I. 78.</note>

The word is used to mean a group of temples.</note>

 </p><p>Bh&#237;ma had three wives Uday&#225;mat&#237; who built a step-well at A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a, Bukul&#225;dev&#237;, and another. These ladies were the mothers of Kar&#7751;a, Kshemar&#225;ja, and M&#250;lar&#225;ja. Of the three sons M&#250;lar&#225;ja, though his mother&#8217;s name is unknown, was the eldest and the heir-apparent. Of the kindly M&#250;lar&#225;ja the author of the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i tells the following tale: In a year of scarcity the Ku&#7789;umbikas or cultivators of Vishopaka and Da&#7751;&#7693;&#225;hi found themselves unable to pay the king his share of the land-produce. Bh&#237;mar&#225;ja sent a minister to inquire and the minister brought before the king all the well-to-do people of the defaulting villages. One day prince M&#250;lar&#225;ja saw these men talking to one another in alarm. Taking pity on them he pleased the king by his skilful riding. The king asked him to name a boon and the prince begged that the demand on the villagers might be remitted. The boon was granted, the ryots went home in glee, but within three days M&#250;lar&#225;ja was dead. Next season yielded a bumper harvest, and the people came to present the king with his share for that year as well as with the remitted share for the previous year. Bh&#237;mdev declined to receive the arrears. A jury appointed by the king settled that the royal share of the produce for both years should be placed in the king&#8217;s hands for the erection of a temple called the new Tripurushapr&#225;s&#225;da for the spiritual welfare of prince M&#250;lar&#225;ja.<note id="n169.2" n="2">Several later mentions of a <hi>Tripurushapr&#225;s&#225;da</hi> show there was only one building of that name. The statement that the great M&#250;lar&#225;ja I. built a Tripurushapr&#225;s&#225;da seems a mistake, due to a confusion with prince M&#250;lar&#225;ja.</note>

According to the Dvy&#225;&#347;raya Bh&#237;ma, wishing to retire to a religious life, offered the succession to Kshemar&#225;ja. But Kshemar&#225;ja also was averse from the labour of ruling and it was settled that Kar&#7751;a should succeed.

 </p><p>Bh&#237;ma died soon after and Kshemar&#225;ja retired to a holy place on the Sarasvat&#237; named Mundake&#347;vara not far from A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a.

By different wives Ud&#225; had five sons, &#193;ha&#7693;a or Astha&#7693;a, Ch&#225;ha&#7693;a, B&#225;ha&#7693;a, &#193;mbada, and Soll&#225;, of whom the last three were half brothers of the first two.<note id="n170.4" n="4">In one passage the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i calls these princes half-brothers of Udaya.

 </p><p>In late life Kar&#7751;a married Miy&#225;&#7751;alladev&#237; daughter of Jayake&#347;i son of &#346;ubhake&#347;i king of the Kar&#7751;&#225;&#7789;aka.

In token of her wish to marry Kar&#7751;a the painter said the princess had sent Kar&#7751;a an elephant. Kar&#7751;a went to see the present and found on the elephant a beautiful princess who had come so far in the hope of winning him for a husband. According to the <corr sic="Prabandhachintama&#7751;i">Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i</corr> Kar&#7751;a found the princess ugly and refused to marry her. On this the princess with eight attendants determined to burn themselves on a funeral pyre and Uday&#225;mat&#237; Kar&#7751;a&#8217;s mother also declared that if he did not relent she too would be a sacrifice. Under this compulsion Kar&#7751;a married the princess but refused to treat her as a wife. The minister <corr sic="Mu&#241;jala">Mu&#241;j&#225;la</corr>, learning from a <hi>ka&#241;chuk&#237;</hi> or palace-servant that the king loved a certain courtezan, contrived that Miy&#225;nalladev&#237; should take the woman&#8217;s place, a device still practised by ministers of native states. Kar&#7751;a fell into the snare and the queen became pregnant by him, having secured from the hand of her husband his signet ring as a token which could not be disclaimed. Thus in Kar&#7751;a&#8217;s old age Miy&#225;nalladev&#237; became the mother of the illustrious Siddhar&#225;ja Jayasim&#803;ha, who, according to a local tradition quoted by Mr. Forbes, first saw the light at P&#225;lanpur.<note id="n171.2" n="2">R&#225;s M&#225;l&#225; (New Edition), 83.</note> When three years old the precocious Siddhar&#225;ja climbed and sat upon the throne.

Mu&#241;j&#225;la and S&#225;ntu continued in office under Siddhar&#225;ja. Another minister built a famous Jain temple named Mah&#225;r&#225;jabhuvana in Sidhpur at the time when Siddhar&#225;ja built the Rudram&#225;l&#225;.

The author of the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i describes Jagaddeva as a thrice valiant warrior held in great respect by Siddhar&#225;ja. After Siddhar&#225;ja&#8217;s death Jagaddeva went to serve king Perm&#225;di to whose mother&#8217;s family he was related.<note id="n172.3" n="3">Goa K&#225;d&#225;mba inscriptions say that <corr sic="Jaggaddeva">Jagaddeva</corr> was the cousin of the Goa K&#225;damba king Vijay&#225;rka the nephew of Miy&#225;nalladev&#237; and call him by courtesy the younger brother of Vijay&#225;rka&#8217;s son Jayake&#347;i II. He would seem to have been held in esteem by Vijay&#225;rka and his son Jayake&#347;i, to have then gone for some time to Siddhar&#225;ja, and after leaving Siddhar&#225;ja to have transferred his services to Perm&#225;di. His being called Param&#225;ra may be due to his connection with Perm&#225;di. Fleet&#8217;s K&#225;narese Dynasties, 91.</note> Perm&#225;di gave him a chiefship and sent him to attack M&#225;lava.

 </p><p>When Siddhar&#225;ja attained manhood his mother prepared to go in great state on pilgrimage to Soman&#225;tha. She went with rich offerings as far as B&#225;hulo&#7693;a apparently the large modern village of Bhol&#225;da on the Gujar&#225;t-K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a frontier about twenty-two miles south-west of Dholk&#225;. At this frontier town the A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a kings levied a tax on all pilgrims to Soman&#225;tha. Many of the pilgrims unable to pay the tax had to return home in tears. Miy&#225;nalladev&#237; was so saddened by the woes of the pilgrims that she stopped her pilgrimage and returned home. Siddhar&#225;ja met her on the way and asked her why she had turned back. Miy&#225;nalladev&#237; said, I will neither eat nor go to Soman&#225;tha until you order the remission of the pilgrim tax. Siddhar&#225;ja called the Bhol&#225;da treasurer and found that the levy yielded 72 l&#225;khs a year.<note id="n172.4" n="4">Seventy-two a favourite number with Indian authors.</note> In spite of the serious sacrifice Siddhar&#225;ja broke the board authorizing the levy of the tax and pouring water from his hand into his mother&#8217;s declared that the merit of the remission was hers. The queen went to Soman&#225;tha and worshipped the god with gold presenting an elephant and other gifts and handing over her own weight in money.

 </p><p>According to the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i while Miy&#225;nalladev&#237; and Siddhar&#225;ja were on pilgrimage Ya&#347;ovarman king of M&#225;lwa continually harassed the Gurjjara-Ma&#7751;&#7693;ala. &#346;&#225;ntu who was in charge of the kingdom asked Ya&#347;ovarman on what consideration he would retire. <pb id="pb173" n="173"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter II.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Chaulukyas, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;961&#8211;1242.</hi></item><item>Siddhar&#225;ja Jayasingha, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1094&#8211;1143.</item></list> </fw>Ya&#347;ovarman said he would retire if Siddhar&#225;ja gave up to him the merit of the pilgrimage to Some&#347;vara.

On his return Siddhar&#225;ja asked S&#225;ntu what he meant by transferring his sovereign&#8217;s merit to a rival. S&#225;ntu said, &#8216;If you think my giving Ya&#347;ovarman your merit has any importance I restore it to you.&#8217;<note id="n173.1" n="1">Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i and Kum&#225;rap&#225;lacharita.</note> This curious story seems to be a Jain fiction probably invented with the object of casting ridicule on the Br&#225;hmanical doctrine of merit. Ya&#347;ovarman was not a cotemporary of Siddhar&#225;ja. The M&#225;lwa king referred to is probably Ya&#347;ovarman&#8217;s predecessor Naravarman, of whom an inscription dated <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1134 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1190) is recorded.<note id="n173.2" n="2">Dr. Kielhorn&#8217;s Report on Sanskrit Manuscripts for 1881 page 22.</note>

 </p><p>Under the name Sadharo Jesingh, Siddhar&#225;ja&#8217;s memory is fresh in Gujar&#225;t as its most powerful, most religious, and most charitable ruler. Almost every old work of architectural or antiquarian interest in Gujar&#225;t is ascribed to Siddhar&#225;ja. In inscriptions he is styled The great king of kings, The great lord, The great Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#225;raka, The lord of Avant&#237;, The hero of the three worlds, The conqueror of Barbaraka, The universal ruler Siddha, The illustrious Jayasim&#803;hadeva. Of these the commonest attributes are Siddhachakravart&#237;n the Emperor of Magic and Siddhar&#225;ja the Lord of Magic, titles which seem to claim for the king divine or supernatural powers.<note id="n173.3" n="3"><p>The Kum&#225;rap&#225;lacharita says that the title was assumed on the conquest of Barbaraka. The verse is:

 <q><text><body><lg type="Group"><l><foreign lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">&#2360;&#2367;&#2342;&#2381;&#2343;&#2379; &#2348;&#2352;&#2381;&#2348;&#2352;&#2325;&#2358;&#2381;&#2357;&#2366;&#2360;&#2381;&#2351; &#2360;&#2367;&#2342;&#2381;&#2343;&#2352;&#2366;&#2332;&#2360;&#2381;&#2340;&#2340;&#2379;&#2349;&#2357;&#2340;&#2381;&#8204;</foreign> </l></lg></body></text></q>

 </p><p rend="noindent">that is, by him the demon Barbaraka was vanquished, therefore he became Siddhar&#225;ja The Lord of Magical Power.</p></note> In connection with his assumption of these titles the Kum&#225;rap&#225;laprabandha, the Dvy&#225;&#347;raya, and the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i tell curious tales. According to the Dvy&#225;&#347;raya, the king wandering by night had subdued the Bh&#250;tas, S&#225;kin&#237;s, and other spirits. He had also learnt many <hi>mantras</hi> or charms. From what he saw at night he would call people in the day time and say &#8216;You have such a cause of uneasiness&#8217; or &#8216;You have such a comfort.&#8217; Seeing that he knew their secrets the people thought that the king knew the hearts of all men and must be the <hi>avat&#225;ra</hi> of some god. A second story tells how Siddhar&#225;ja helped a N&#225;ga prince and princess whom he met by night on the Sarasvat&#237;.<note id="n173.4" n="4"><abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> IV. 265.</note> According to a third story told in the Kum&#225;rap&#225;laprabandha two Yogin&#237;s or nymphs came from the Him&#225;layas and asked the king by what mystic powers he justified the use of the title Siddhar&#225;ja. The king agreed to perform some wonders in open court in the presence of the nymphs. With the help of a former minister, Harip&#225;la, the king had a dagger prepared whose blade was of sugar and its handle of iron set with jewels. When the king appeared in court to perform the promised wonders a deputation of ambassadors from king Perm&#225;di of <corr sic="Kaly&#225;nakataka">Kaly&#225;naka&#7789;aka</corr><note id="n173.5" n="5">This Perm&#225;di may be the Goa K&#225;damba chief Perm&#225;di &#346;ivachitta (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1147&#8211;1175), who was heir-apparent in the time of Siddhar&#225;ja, or the Sinda chief Perm&#225;di who was a cotemporary of Siddhar&#225;ja and flourished in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1144.</note> was <pb id="pb174" n="174"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter II.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Chaulukyas, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;961&#8211;1242.</hi></item><item>Siddhar&#225;ja Jayasingha, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1094&#8211;1143.</item></list> </fw>announced. The deputation entered and presented the prepared dagger as a gift from their lord. The king kept the prepared dagger and in its stead sent all round the court a real dagger which was greatly admired. After the real dagger had been seen and returned the king said: I will use this dagger to show my mystic powers, and in its place taking the false dagger ate its sugar blade. When the blade was eaten the minister stopped the king and said Let the Yogin&#237;s eat the handle. The king agreed and as the Yogin&#237;s failed to eat the handle which was iron the superiority of the king&#8217;s magic was proved.

 </p><p>A fourth story in the Dvy&#225;&#347;raya tells that when the king was planning an invasion of M&#225;lwa a Yogin&#237; came from Ujjain to Patan and said &#8216;O R&#225;ja, if you desire great fame, come to Ujjain and humbly entreat K&#225;lika and other Yogin&#237;s and make friends with Ya&#347;ovarman the R&#225;ja of Ujjain.&#8217; The king contemptuously dismissed her, saying, &#8216;If you do not fly hence like a female crow, I will cut off your nose and ears with this sword.&#8217;

 </p><p>So also the king&#8217;s acts of prowess and courage were believed to be due to magical aid. According to the common belief Siddhar&#225;ja did his great acts of heroism by the help of a demon named B&#225;baro, whom he is said to have subdued by riding on a corpse in a burying ground. The story in the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i is similar to that told of the father of Harshavardhana who subdued a demon with the help of a Yog&#237;. It is notable that the story had passed into its present form within a hundred years of Siddhar&#225;ja&#8217;s death. Some&#347;vara in his K&#237;rtikaumud&#237; says, &#8216;This moon of kings fettered the prince of goblins Barbaraka in a burial-place, and became known among the crowd of kings as Siddhar&#225;ja.&#8217; Older records show that the origin of the story, at least of the demon&#8217;s name, is historical being traceable to one of Siddhar&#225;ja&#8217;s copperplate attributes Barbaraka-jish&#7751;u that is conqueror of Barbaraka. The Dvy&#225;&#347;rayakosha represents this Barbara as a leader of R&#225;kshasas or Mlechhas, who troubled the Br&#225;hmans at &#346;r&#237;sthala-Siddhapura. Jayasim&#803;ha conquered him and spared his life at the instance of his wife Pin&#775;galik&#225;. Afterwards Barbara gave valuable presents to Jayasim&#803;ha and &#8216;served him as other <corr sic="Rajputs">R&#225;jputs</corr>.&#8217;<note id="n174.1" n="1"><abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> IV. 2. Regarding Barbaraka Doctor B&#252;hler remarks in <abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> VI. 167: &#8216;The Varvarakas are one of the non-Aryan tribes which are settled in great numbers in North <corr sic="Guj&#225;r&#225;t">Gujar&#225;t</corr>, Koli, Bh&#237;l, or Mer.&#8217; Siddhar&#225;ja&#8217;s contests with the Barbarakas seem to refer to what Tod (Western India, 173 and 195) describes as the inroads of mountaineers and foresters on the plains of Gujar&#225;t during the eleventh and twelfth centuries. To attempt to identify Bhut Barbar or Varvar is hazardous. The name Barbar is of great age and is spread from India to Morocco. Wilson (Works, VII. 176) says: The analogy between Barbaras and barbarians is not in sound only. In all Sanskrit authorities Barbaras are classed with borderers and foreigners and nations not Hindu. According to Sir Henry Rawlinson (Ferrier&#8217;s Caravan <corr sic="Journies">Journeys</corr>, 223 note) tribes of Berbers are found all over the east. Of the age of the word Canon Rawlinson (Herodotus, IV. 252) writes: Barbar seems to be the local name for the early race of Accad. In India Ptolemy (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;150; McCrindle&#8217;s Edn. 146) has a town Barbarei on the Indus and the Periplus (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;247; McCrindle&#8217;s Ed. 108) has a trade-centre Barbarikon on the middle mouth of the Indus. Among Indian writings, in the <corr sic="Ram&#225;yana">Ram&#225;ya&#7751;a</corr> (Hall in Wilson&#8217;s Works, VII. 176 Note *) the Barbaras appear between the Tukh&#225;ras and the Kambojas in the north: in the Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata (Muir&#8217;s Sanskrit Texts, I. 481&#8211;2) in one list Var-varas are entered between S&#225;varas and &#346;akas and in another list (Wilson&#8217;s Works, VII. 176) <pb/>Barbaras come between Kiratas and Siddhas. Finally (<abbr>As. Res.</abbr> XV. 47 footnote) Barbara is the northmost of the Seven Konkanas. The names Barbarei in Ptolemy and Barbarikon in the Periplus look like some local place-name, perhaps Bambhara, altered to a Greek form. The Hindu tribe names, from the sameness in sound as well as from their position on the north-west border of India, suggest the Mongol tribe Ju&#225;n-Ju&#225;n or Var-Var, known to the western nations as <corr sic="Av&#225;rs">Avars</corr>, who drove the Little Yuechi out of Balkh in the second half of the fourth century, and, for about a hundred years, ruled to the north and perhaps also to the south of the Hindu Kush. (Specht in Journal Asiatique 1883. II. 390&#8211;410; Howorth in <abbr>Jour. R. A. S.</abbr> XXI. 721&#8211;810.) It seems probable that some of these Var-Vars passed south either before or along with the White <corr sic="Hu&#7751;as">H&#250;&#7751;as</corr> (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;450&#8211;550). Var, under its Mongol plural form Avarti (Howorth, Ditto 722), closely resembles Avartiya one of the two main divisions of the K&#225;this of Kacch (Mr. Erskine&#8217;s List in J. Bom. Geo. Soc. II. 59&#8211;60 for Aug. 1838). That among the forty-seven clans included under the Avartiyas four (Nos. 30, 35, 42, and 43) are Babariyas, suggests that the K&#225;this received additions from the Var-Vars at different times and places. Dr. B&#252;hler (<abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> VI. 186) thinks that the Babaro or Barbar or Var-Var who gave trouble to Siddhar&#225;ja represent some early local non-Aryan tribe. The fact that they are called R&#225;kshasas and Mlecchas and that they stopped the ceremonies at <corr sic="Siddhpur">Sidhpur</corr> north of <corr sic="Anahilav&#225;&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a</corr> seems rather to point to a foreign invasion from the north than to a local uprising of hill tribes. Though no Musalm&#225;n invasion of Gujar&#225;t during the reign of Siddhar&#225;ja is recorded a Jesalmir legend (Forbes&#8217; R&#225;s M&#225;l&#225;, I. 175) tells how Lanja Bijirao the Bhatti prince who married Siddhar&#225;ja&#8217;s daughter was hailed by his mother-in-law as the bulwark of <corr sic="Anahilav&#225;&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a</corr> against the power of the king who grows too strong. This king may be B&#225;halim the Indian viceroy of the Ghaznavid Bahr&#225;m Sh&#225;h (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1116&#8211;1157). B&#225;halim (Elliot, II. 279; Briggs&#8217; Ferista, I. 151) collected an army of Arabs, Persians, Afgh&#225;ns, and Khiljis, repaired the fort of N&#225;gor in the province of Sew&#225;lik, and committed great devastations in the territories of the independent Indian rulers. He threw off allegiance to Ghazni and advancing to meet Bahr&#225;m Sh&#225;h near Mult&#225;n was defeated and slain. Except that they were northerners and that B&#225;halim&#8217;s is the only known invasion from the north during Siddhar&#225;ja&#8217;s reign nothing has been found connecting Barbar and B&#225;halim. At the same time that the Barbar or Var-Var of the Gujar&#225;t writers may have been non-Hindu mercenaries from the north-west frontier whom Siddhar&#225;ja admitted as Hindu subjects is made not unlikely by two incidents preserved by the Muhammadan historians. The T&#225;rikh-i-Sor&#225;th (Bayley&#8217;s Gujar&#225;t, 35 Note *) tells how in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1178 from the defeated army of Shah&#225;b-ud-din Ghori the Turkish Afgh&#225;n and Moghal women were distributed the higher class to high caste and the commoner to low caste Hindus. Similarly how the better class of male captives were <corr sic="ad mitted">admitted</corr> among Chak&#225;val and Wadh&#225;l <corr sic="Rajputs">R&#225;jputs</corr> and the lower among Kh&#225;nts, Kolis, B&#225;brias, and Mers. Again about thirty years later (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1210) when his Turk mercenaries, who were not converted to Isl&#225;m, revolted against <corr sic="Shamsu-ud-din">Shams-ud-d&#237;n</corr> Altamsh they seized Delhi and built Hindu temples (Elliot, II. 237&#8211;239). These cases seem to make it likely that among B&#225;halim&#8217;s mercenaries were some un-Islamised North Indian Var-Vars and that they were admitted into Hinduism by Siddhar&#225;ja and as the story states served him as other <corr sic="Rajputs">R&#225;jputs</corr>. Some of the new-comers as noted above seem to have merged into the K&#225;this. Others founded or joined the <corr sic="Babari&#225;s">B&#225;bari&#225;s</corr> who give their name to B&#225;bari&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a a small division in the south of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a. Though the tribe is now small the 72 divisions of the B&#225;bari&#225;s show that they were once important. One of their leading divisions preserves the early form Var (K&#225;thi&#225;w&#225;r Gazetteer, 132&#8211;133) and supports their separate northern origin, which is forgotten in the local stories that they are descended from <corr sic="Jetvas">Jethv&#225;s</corr> and Ahirs and have a Br&#225;hman element in their ancestry. (Tod&#8217;s Western India, 413; K&#225;thi&#225;w&#225;r Gazetteer, 132&#8211;123.) Of the Var-Vars in their old seats a somewhat doubtful trace remains in the Barbaris a tribe of Haz&#225;r&#225;hs near Herat (Bellew in Imp. and As. Quar. Review Oct. 1891 page 328) and in the Panj&#225;b (Ibbetson&#8217;s Census, 538) Bh&#225;bras a class of Panj&#225;b Jains.</note> Barbaraka <pb id="pb175" n="175"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter II.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Chaulukyas, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;961&#8211;1242.</hi></item><item>Siddhar&#225;ja Jayasingha, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1094&#8211;1143.</item></list> </fw>seems to be the name of a tribe of non-&#193;ryans whose modern representatives are the B&#225;bari&#225;s settled in South K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a in the province still known as B&#225;bari&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a.

 </p><p>A Dohad inscription of the time of Siddhar&#225;ja dated <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1140 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1196) says of his frontier wars: &#8216;He threw into prison the lords of Sur&#225;sh&#7789;ra and M&#225;lwa; he destroyed Sindhur&#225;ja and other kings; he made the kings of the north bear his commands.&#8217; The Sur&#225;sh&#7789;ra king referred to is probably a ruler of the &#193;h&#237;r or <corr sic="Chud&#225;sam&#225;">Ch&#250;&#7693;&#225;sam&#225;</corr> tribe <pb id="pb176" n="176"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter II.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Chaulukyas, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;961&#8211;1242.</hi></item><item>Siddhar&#225;ja Jayasingha, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1094&#8211;1143.</item></list> </fw>whose head-quarters were at Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h. According to the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i Siddhar&#225;ja went in person to subdue Noghan or Navaghani the &#193;h&#237;r ruler of Sur&#225;sh&#7789;ra; he came to Vardham&#225;napura that is Vadhv&#225;n and from Vadhv&#225;n attacked and slew Noghan. Jinaprabhas&#250;ri the author of the T&#237;rthakalpa says of Girn&#225;r that Jayasim&#803;ha killed the king named Kheng&#225;r and made one Sajjana his viceroy in Sur&#225;sh&#7789;ra. So many traditions remain regarding wars with Kheng&#225;r that it seems probable that Siddhar&#225;ja led separate expeditions against more than one king of that name. According to tradition the origin of the war with Kheng&#225;r was a woman named R&#225;&#7751;akadev&#237; whom Kheng&#225;ra had married. R&#225;nakadev&#237; was the daughter of a potter of Majev&#225;di village about nine miles north of Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h, so famous for her beauty that Siddhar&#225;ja determined to marry her. Meanwhile she had accepted an offer from Kheng&#225;r whose subject she was and had married him. Siddhar&#225;ja enraged at her marriage advanced against Kheng&#225;r, took him prisoner, and annexed Sorath. That Kheng&#225;r&#8217;s kingdom was annexed and Sajjana, mentioned by Jinaprabhas&#250;ri, was appointed Viceroy is proved by a Girn&#225;r inscription dated <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1120 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1176).

 </p><p>An era called the Sim&#803;ha Sam&#803;vatsara connected with the name of Jayasim&#803;ha and beginning with <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1113&#8211;1114 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1169&#8211;70), occurs in several inscriptions found about Prabh&#225;sa and South K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a. This era was probably started in that year in honour of this conquest of Kheng&#225;r and Sorath.<note id="n176.1" n="1">Abhayatilaka Ga&#7751;i who revised and completed the Dvy&#225;&#347;raya in Vikrama <abbr>S.</abbr> 1312 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1256) says, in his twentieth Sarga, that a new era was started by Kum&#225;rap&#225;la. This would seem to refer to the Sim&#803;ha era.</note> The earliest known mention of the Sim&#803;ha Sam&#803;vatsara era occurs in a step-well at M&#225;ngrol called the Sodhali V&#225;v. The inscription is of the time of Kum&#225;rap&#225;la and mentions Sahajiga the father of M&#250;laka the grantor as a member of the bodyguard of the Ch&#225;lukyas. The inscription states that Sahajiga had several sons able to protect Saur&#225;sh&#7789;ra, one of whom was Somar&#225;ja who built the temple of Sahajige&#347;vara, in the enclosure of the Soman&#225;tha temple at Prabh&#225;sa; another was M&#250;laka the <hi>n&#225;yaka</hi> of <corr sic="Surash&#7789;ra">Sur&#225;sh&#7789;ra</corr>, who is recorded to have made grants for the worship of the god by establishing cesses in Mangalapura or M&#225;ngrol and other places. The inscription is dated <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1146 (Monday the 13th of the dark half of A&#347;v&#237;n Vikrama <abbr>S.</abbr> 1202 and Sim&#803;ha <abbr>S.</abbr> 32). This inscription supports the view that the Sim&#803;ha era was established by Jayasim&#803;ha, since if the era belonged to some other local chief, no Ch&#225;lukya viceroy would adopt it. The Sim&#803;ha era appears to have been kept up in Gujar&#225;t so long as A&#7751;ahilapura rule lasted. The well known Ver&#225;val inscription of the time of Arju&#7751;adeva is dated Hijri 662, Vikrama <abbr>S.</abbr> 1320, Valabhi <abbr>S.</abbr> 945, Sim&#803;ha <abbr>S.</abbr> 151, Sunday the 13th of <corr sic="Ash&#225;&#7693;ha">&#193;sh&#225;&#7693;ha</corr> Vadi. This inscription shows that the Sim&#803;ha era was in use for a century and a half during the sovereignty of <corr sic="Anahilav&#225;&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a</corr> in Sur&#225;sh&#7789;ra.

 </p><p>Regarding Sajjana Siddhar&#225;ja&#8217;s first viceroy in Sur&#225;sh&#7789;ra, the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i says that finding him worthy the king appointed Sajjana the <hi>da&#7751;&#7693;&#225;dhipati</hi> of Sur&#225;sh&#7789;rade&#347;a. Without consulting his master Sajjana spent three years&#8217; revenue in building a stone temple of <pb id="pb177" n="177"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter II.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Chaulukyas, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;961&#8211;1242.</hi></item><item>Siddhar&#225;ja Jayasingha, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1094&#8211;1143.</item></list> </fw>Nemin&#225;tha on Girn&#225;r instead of a wooden temple which he removed. In the fourth year the king sent four officers to bring Sajjana to A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a. The king called on Sajjana to pay the revenues of the past three years. In reply Sajjana asked whether the king would prefer the revenue in cash or the merit which had accrued from spending the revenue in building the temple. Preferring the merit the king sanctioned the spending of the revenues on the T&#237;rtha and Sajjana was reappointed governor of Sorath.<note id="n177.1" n="1">The Kum&#225;rap&#225;lacharita states that Sajjana died before the temple was finished, and that the temple was completed by his son Para&#347;ur&#225;ma. After the temple was finished Siddhar&#225;ja is said to have come to Soman&#225;tha and asked Para&#347;ur&#225;ma for the revenues of Sorath. But on seeing the temple on Girn&#225;r he was greatly pleased, and on finding that it was called Kar&#7751;a-vih&#225;ra after his father he sanctioned the outlay on the temple.</note> This stone temple of Sajjana would seem to be the present temple of Nemin&#225;tha, though many alterations have been made in consequence of Muhammadan sacrilege and a modern enclosure has been added. The inscription of Sajjana which is dated <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1120 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1176) is on the inside to the right in passing to the small south gate. It contains little but the mention of the S&#225;dhu who was Sajjana&#8217;s constant adviser. On his return from a second pilgrimage to Soman&#225;tha Siddhar&#225;ja who was encamped near Raivataka that is Girn&#225;r expressed a wish to see Sajjana&#8217;s temple. But the Br&#225;hmans envious of the Jains persuaded the king that as Girn&#225;r was shaped like a <hi>lin&#775;g</hi> it would be sacrilege to climb it. Siddhar&#225;ja respected this objection and worshipped at the foot of the mountain. From Girn&#225;r he went to &#346;atru&#241;jaya. Here too Br&#225;hmans with drawn swords tried to prevent the king ascending the hill. Siddhar&#225;ja went in disguise at night, worshipped the Jain god &#193;d&#237;&#347;vara with Ganges water, and granted the god twelve neighbouring villages. On the hill he saw so luxuriant a growth of the <hi>s&#225;llaki</hi> a plant dear to elephants, that he proposed to make the hill a breeding place for elephants a second Vindhya. He was reminded what damage wild elephants would cause to the holy place and for this reason abandoned his plan.

 </p><p>Siddhar&#225;ja&#8217;s second and greater war was with M&#225;lwa. The cotemporary kings of M&#225;lwa were the Param&#225;ra ruler Naravarman who flourished from <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1104 to 1133 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1160&#8211;1189) and his son and successor Ya&#347;ovarman who ruled up to <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1143 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1199) the year of Siddhar&#225;ja&#8217;s death As the names of both these kings occur in different accounts of this war, and, as the war is said to have lasted twelve years, it seems that fighting began in the time of Naravarman and that Siddhar&#225;ja&#8217;s final victory was gained in the time of Ya&#347;ovarman in Siddhar&#225;ja&#8217;s old age about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1134 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1190). This view is supported by the local story that his expedition against Ya&#347;ovarman was undertaken while Siddhar&#225;ja was building the Sahasralin&#775;ga lake and other religious works. It is not known how the war arose but the statement of the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i that Siddhar&#225;ja vowed to make a scabbard of Ya&#347;ovarman&#8217;s skin seems to show that Siddhar&#225;ja received grave provocation. Siddhar&#225;ja is said to have left the building of the Sahasralin&#775;ga lake to the masons and architects and himself to have <pb id="pb178" n="178"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter II.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Chaulukyas, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;961&#8211;1242.</hi></item><item>Siddhar&#225;ja Jayasingha, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1094&#8211;1143.</item></list> </fw>started for M&#225;lwa. The war dragged on and there seemed little hope of victory when news reached Siddhar&#225;ja that the three south gates of Dh&#225;r&#225; could be forced. With the help of an elephant an entrance was effected. Ya&#347;ovarman was captured and bound with six ropes, and, with his captured enemy as his banner of victory, Siddhar&#225;ja returned to A&#7751;ahilapura. He remembered his vow, but being prevented from carrying it out, he took a little of Ya&#347;ovarman&#8217;s skin and adding other skin to it made a scabbard. The captured king was thenceforward kept in a cage. It was this complete conquest and annexation of M&#225;lwa that made Siddhar&#225;ja assume the style of Avant&#237;n&#225;tha &#8216;Lord of Avant&#237;,&#8217; which is mentioned as his <hi>biru&#7693;a</hi> or title in most of the Chaulukya copperplates.<note id="n178.1" n="1"><abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> VI. 194ff. Dr. B&#252;hler (Ditto) takes Avant&#237;n&#225;tha to mean Siddhar&#225;ja&#8217;s opponent the king of M&#225;lwa and not Siddhar&#225;ja himself.</note> M&#225;lwa henceforward remained subject to A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a. On the return from M&#225;lwa an army of Bh&#237;ls who tried to block the way were attacked by the minister S&#225;ntu and put to flight.

 </p><p>Siddhar&#225;ja&#8217;s next recorded war is with king Madanavarman the Chandela king of Mahobaka the modern Mahob&#225; in Bundelkhand. Madanavarman, of whom General Cunningham has found numerous inscriptions dating from <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1130 to 1164 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1186&#8211;1220),<note id="n178.2" n="2">Arch&#230;ological Survey Report, XXI. 86.</note> was one of the most famous kings of the Chandela dynasty. An inscription of one of his successors in K&#225;lanjar fort records that Madanavarman &#8216;in an instant defeated the king of Gurjjara, as K&#7771;ish&#7751;a in former times defeated Kam&#803;sa,<note id="n178.3" n="3"><abbr>Jour. B. A. Soc.</abbr> (1848), 319.</note> a statement which agrees with the Gujar&#225;t accounts of the war between him and Jayasim&#803;ha. In this conflict the Gujar&#225;t accounts do not seem to show that Siddhar&#225;ja gained any great victory; he seems to have been contented with a money present. The K&#237;rtikaumud&#237; states that the king of Mahobaka honoured Siddhar&#225;ja as his guest and paid a fine and tribute by way of hospitality. The account in the Kum&#225;rap&#225;lacharita suggests that Siddhar&#225;ja was compelled to come to terms and make peace. According to the K&#237;rtikaumud&#237;, and this seems likely, Siddhar&#225;ja went from Dh&#225;r&#225; to <corr sic="K&#225;la&#241;jara">K&#225;lanjara</corr>. The account in the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i is very confused. According to the Kum&#225;rap&#225;lacharita, on Siddhar&#225;ja&#8217;s way back from Dh&#225;r&#225; at his camp near Patan a bard came to the court and said to the king that his court was as wonderful as the court of Madanavarman. The bard said that Madanavarman was the king of the city of Mahobaka and most clever, wise, liberal, and pleasure-loving. The king sent a courtier to test the truth of the bard&#8217;s statement. The courtier returned after six months declaring that the bard&#8217;s account was in no way exaggerated. Hearing this Siddhar&#225;ja at once started against Mahobaka and encamping within sixteen miles of the city sent his minister to summon Madanavarman to surrender. Madanavarman who was enjoying himself took little notice of the minister. This king, he said, is the same who had to fight twelve years with Dh&#225;r&#225;; if, as is probable, since he is a <hi>kab&#225;di</hi> or wild king, he wants money, pay him what he wants. The money <pb id="pb179" n="179"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter II.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Chaulukyas, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;961&#8211;1242.</hi></item><item>Siddhar&#225;ja Jayasingha, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1094&#8211;1143.</item></list> </fw>was paid. But Siddhar&#225;ja was so struck with Madanavarman&#8217;s indifference that he would not leave until he had seen him. Madanavarman agreed to receive him. Siddhar&#225;ja went with a large bodyguard to the royal garden which contained a palace and enclosed pleasure-house and was guarded by troops. Only four of Siddhar&#225;ja&#8217;s guards were allowed to enter. With these four men Siddhar&#225;ja went in, was shown the palace garden and pleasure-houses by Madanavarman, was treated with great hospitality, and on his return to Patan was given a guard of 120 men.

 </p><p>The Dvy&#225;&#347;raya says that after his conquest of Ujjain Siddhar&#225;ja seized and imprisoned the king of a neighbouring country named Sim. We have no other information on this point.

 </p><p>The Dohad inscription dated <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1140 mentions the destruction of Sindhur&#225;ja that is the king of Sindh and other kings. The K&#237;rtikaumud&#237; also mentions the binding of the lord of Sindhu. Nothing is known regarding the Sindh war. The K&#237;rtikaumud&#237; mentions that after a war with Ar&#7751;or&#225;ja king of S&#225;mbhar Siddhar&#225;ja gave his daughter to Ar&#7751;or&#225;ja. This seems to be a mistake as the war and alliance with Ar&#7751;or&#225;ja belong to Kum&#225;rap&#225;la&#8217;s reign.

 </p><p>Siddhar&#225;ja, who like his ancestors was a &#346;aiva, showed his zeal for the faith by constructing the two grandest works in Gujar&#225;t the Rudramah&#225;laya at <corr sic="Siddhpur">Sidhpur</corr> and the Sahasralin&#775;ga lake at Patan. The Jain chroniclers always try to show that Siddhar&#225;ja was favourably inclined to Jainism. But several of his acts go against this claim and some even show a dislike of the Jains. It is true that the Jain sage Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya lived with the king, but the king honoured him as a scholar rather than as a Jain. On the occasion of the pilgrimage to Soman&#225;tha the king offered Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya a palanquin, and, as he would not accept the offer but kept on walking, the king blamed him calling him a learned fool with no worldly wisdom. Again on one occasion while returning from M&#225;lwa Siddhar&#225;ja encamped at a place called &#346;r&#237;nagara, where the people had decorated their temples with banners in honour of the king. Finding a banner floating over a Jain temple the king asked in anger who had placed it there, as he had forbidden the use of banners on Jain shrines and temples in Gujar&#225;t. On being told that it was a very old shrine dating from the time of Bharata, the king ordered that at the end of a year the banner might be replaced. This shows the reverse of a leaning to Jainism. Similarly, according to the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i, Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya never dared to speak to the king in favour of Jainism but used to say that all religions were good. This statement is supported by the fact that the opening verses of all works written by Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya in the time of Siddhar&#225;ja contain no special praise of Jain deities.

 </p><p>So great is Siddhar&#225;ja&#8217;s fame as a builder that almost every old work in Gujar&#225;t is ascribed to him. Tradition gives him the credit of the Dabhoi fort which is of the time of the V&#225;ghel&#225; king V&#237;radhavala, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1220&#8211;1260. The Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i gives this old verse regarding Siddhar&#225;ja&#8217;s public works: &#8216;No one makes a great temple (Rudramah&#225;laya), a great pilgrimage (to Soman&#225;tha), a great &#193;sth&#225;na (darb&#225;r hall), or a great lake (Sahasralin&#775;ga) <pb id="pb180" n="180"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter II.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Chaulukyas, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;961&#8211;1242.</hi></item><item>Siddhar&#225;ja Jayasingha, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1094&#8211;1143.</item></list> </fw>such as Siddhar&#225;ja made.&#8217;<note id="n180.1" n="1">The original verse is <foreign lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">&#2350;&#2361;&#2366;&#2354;&#2351;&#2379; &#2350;&#2361;&#2366;&#2351;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2352;&#2366; &#2350;&#2361;&#2366;&#2360;&#2381;&#2341;&#2366;&#2344;&#2306; &#2350;&#2361;&#2366;&#2360;&#2352;&#2307; &#2351;&#2340;&#2381;&#2325;&#2371;&#2340;&#2306; &#2360;&#2367;&#2342;&#2381;&#2343;&#2352;&#2366;&#2332;&#2375;&#2344; &#2325;&#2381;&#2352;&#2367;&#2351;&#2340;&#2375; &#2340;&#2344;&#2381;&#2344; &#2325;&#2375;&#2344;&#2330;&#2367;&#2340;&#2381;&#8204; &#2405;</foreign></note> Of these the Rudramah&#225;laya, though very little is left, from its size and the beauty of its carving, must have been a magnificent work the grandest specimen of the architecture of the Solan&#775;ki period. The remains of the Sahasralin&#775;ga lake at A&#7751;ahilapura show that it must have been a work of surprising size and richness well deserving its title of <hi>mah&#225;sarah&#803;</hi> or great lake. Numerous other public works are ascribed to Siddhar&#225;ja.<note id="n180.2" n="2">These, as quoted by R&#225;o S&#225;heb Mah&#237;patr&#225;m R&#250;pr&#225;m in his Sadhara Jesangh, are, the erection of charitable feeding-houses every <hi>yojana</hi> or four miles, of Dabhoi fort, of a <hi>ku&#7751;da</hi> or reservoir at <corr sic="K&#225;padvanj">Kapadvanj</corr>, of the M&#225;lavya lake at Dholk&#225;, of small temples, of the Rudramah&#225;laya, of the R&#225;ni&#8217;s step-well, of the Sahasralin&#775;ga lake, of reservoirs at Sihor, of the fort of S&#225;el&#225;, of the Da&#347;asahasra or ten thousand temples, of the Mu&#7751;a lake at Viramg&#225;m, of the <hi>gadhs</hi> or forts of Dadharapur<corr>,</corr> Vadhw&#225;n Anantapur and Chub&#225;ri, of the Sardh&#225;r lake, of the <hi>gadhs</hi> of Jhinjhuv&#225;&#7693;a, Virpur, Bh&#225;dula, V&#225;singapura, and Th&#225;n, of the palaces of Kandola and Sihi Jagapura, of the reservoirs of Ded&#225;dr&#225; and K&#237;rtti-stambha and of Jitpur-Anantpura. It is doubtful how many of these were actually Siddhar&#225;ja&#8217;s works.</note>

 </p><p>At this period it seems that the kings of Gujar&#225;t S&#225;mbhar and other districts, seeing the great reputation which his literary tastes had gained for Bhoja of Dh&#225;r&#225; used all to keep Pandits. Certain carvings on the pillars of a mosque at the south-west of the modern town of Dh&#225;r&#225; show that the building almost as it stands was the Sanskrit school founded by Bhoja. The carvings in question are beautifully cut Sanskrit grammar tables. Other inscriptions in praise of Naravarman show that Bhoja&#8217;s successors continued to maintain the institution. In the floor of the mosque are many large shining slabs of black marble, the largest as much as seven feet long, all of them covered with inscriptions so badly mutilated that nothing can be made out of them except that they were Sanskrit and Prakrit verses in honour of some prince. On a rough estimate the slabs contain as many as 4000 verses.<note id="n180.3" n="3">One of the best preserved slabs was sent by Sir John Malcolm when Resident of M&#225;lwa to the Museum of the <abbr>B. B. R. A. S.</abbr>, where it still lies. It has verses in twelfth century Prakrit in honour of a king, but nothing historical can be made out of it.</note> According to the old saying any one who drank of the Sarasvat&#237; well in Dh&#225;r&#225; became a scholar. Sarasvat&#237;&#8217;s well still exists near the mosque. Its water is good and it is still known as Akkal-kui or the Well of Talent. As in Dh&#225;r&#225; so in Ajmir the A&#7771;h&#225;&#237;-dink&#225; Jhop&#7693;&#225; mosque is an old Sanskrit school, recent excavations having brought to light slabs with entire dramas carved on them. So also the Gujar&#225;t kings had their Pandits and their halls of learning. &#346;r&#237;p&#225;la, Siddhar&#225;ja&#8217;s poet-laureate, wrote a poetical eulogium or <hi>pra&#347;asti</hi> on the Sahasralin&#775;ga lake. According to the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i Siddhar&#225;ja gathered numerous Pandits to examine the eulogium.

Devas&#250;ri treated his visitor with little respect telling him to go to Patan and he would follow and hold a religious discussion or <hi>v&#225;da</hi>. Kumudachandra being a Digambara or skyclad Jaina went naked to Patan and Siddhar&#225;ja honoured him because he came from his mother&#8217;s country. Siddhar&#225;ja asked Hemachandra to hold a discussion with Kumudachandra and Hemachandra recommended that Devas&#250;ri should be invited as a worthy disputant. At a discussion held before a meeting called by the king Kumudachandra was vanquished, probably because the first principle of his Digambara faith that no woman can attain <hi>nirv&#225;&#7751;a</hi>, was insulting to the queen-mother, and the second that no clothes-wearing Jain can gain <hi>mukti</hi> or absorption, was an insult to the Jain ministers. The assembly, like Br&#225;hmanical <hi>sabh&#225;s</hi> at the present day, appears to have declined into noise and Siddhar&#225;ja had to interfere and keep order. Devas&#250;ri was complimented by the king and taken by one &#193;hada with great honour to his newly built Jaina temple.<note id="n181.2" n="2">Devas&#250;ri was born in <abbr>S.</abbr> 1134 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1078), took <hi>d&#237;ksh&#225;</hi> in <abbr>S.</abbr> 1152 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1096), became a S&#250;ri in <abbr>S.</abbr> 1174 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1118), and died on a Thursday in the dark half of Sr&#225;va&#7751;a <abbr>S.</abbr> 1226 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1170).

Kum&#225;rap&#225;la himself was married by his father to one Bhup&#225;ladev&#237;. According to the Dvy&#225;&#347;raya, Tribhuvanap&#225;la was on good terms with Siddhar&#225;ja serving him and going with him to war. The Kum&#225;rap&#225;lacharita also states that Kum&#225;rap&#225;la used to attend the court of Siddhar&#225;ja<corr>.</corr> But from the time he came to feel that he would have no son and that the bastard Kum&#225;rap&#225;la would succeed him Siddhar&#225;ja became embittered against Kum&#225;rap&#225;la. According to the Jain chronicles Siddhar&#225;ja was told by the god Soman&#225;tha, by the sage Hemachandra, by the goddess Ambik&#225; of Kodin&#225;r,<note id="n182.1" n="1">Kodin&#225;r is a town in G&#225;ikw&#225;r territory in South K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a. This temple of Ambik&#225; is noticed as a place of Jain pilgrimage by the sage Jinaprabhas&#250;ri in his T&#237;rthakalpa and was a well-known Jain shrine during the <corr sic="Anahilav&#225;&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a</corr> period.</note> and by astrologers that he would have no son and that Kum&#225;rap&#225;la would be his successor. According to the Kum&#225;rap&#225;lacharita so bitter did his hate grow that Siddhar&#225;ja planned the death of Tribhuvanap&#225;la and his family including Kum&#225;rap&#225;la. Tribhuvanap&#225;la was murdered but Kum&#225;rap&#225;la escaped. Grieved at this proof of the king&#8217;s hatred Kum&#225;rap&#225;la consulted his brother-in-law K&#7771;ish&#7751;adeva who advised him to leave his family at Dahithal&#237; and go into exile promising to keep him informed of what went on at A&#7751;ahilapura. Kum&#225;rap&#225;la left in the disguise of a <hi>ja&#7789;&#225;dh&#225;ri</hi> or recluse and escaped the assassins whom the king had ordered to slay him. After some time Kum&#225;rap&#225;la returned and in spite of his disguise was recognized by the guards. They informed the king who invited all the ascetics in the city to a dinner. Kum&#225;rap&#225;la came but noticing that the king recognized him in spite of his disguise, he fled. The king sent a trusted officer with a small force in pursuit. Kum&#225;rap&#225;la persuaded some husbandmen, the chief of whom was Bh&#237;masim&#803;ha, to hide him in a heap of thorns. The pursuers failing to find him returned. At night Kum&#225;rap&#225;la was let out bleeding from the thorns, and promised the husbandmen that the day would come when their help would be rewarded. He then shaved his topknot or <hi>ja&#7789;&#225;</hi> and while travelling met with a lady named Deva&#347;r&#237; of Udambara village who pitying him took him into her chariot and gave him food. Kum&#225;rap&#225;la promised to regard her as a sister. He then came to Dahithal&#237; where the royal troops had already arrived. Siddhar&#225;ja sent an army which invested the village leaving Kum&#225;rap&#225;la without means of escape. He went to a potter named Sajjana or Alin&#775;ga who hid him in the flues of his brick-kiln throwing hay over him. The troops searched the village, failed to find Kum&#225;rap&#225;la, and retired. The potter then helped Kum&#225;rap&#225;la from his hiding place and fed him. A former friend named Bosari joined Kum&#225;rap&#225;la and they went away together Kum&#225;rap&#225;la commending his family to the care of Sajjana. On the first day they had no food. Next day Bosari went to beg and they together ate the food given to Bosari in a monastery or <hi>ma&#7789;h</hi> where they slept. In time they came to Cambay where they called upon Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya and asked him their future. Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya knew and recognized Kum&#225;rap&#225;la. Kum&#225;rap&#225;la asked when fate would bless him.

Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya said to Udayana, &#8216;This is Kum&#225;rap&#225;la who shall shortly be your king.&#8217; Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya also gave Kum&#225;rap&#225;la a writing stating that he would succeed to the throne. Kum&#225;rap&#225;la acknowledged his obligations to Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya and promised to follow his advice. Udayana took him to his house and gave him food and clothes. Siddhar&#225;ja came to know of this and sent his soldiers who began to search. Kum&#225;rap&#225;la returned to Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya who hid him in a cellar covering its door with manuscripts and palm leaves. The soldiers came but failed to search under the manuscripts and returned. Kum&#225;rap&#225;la acknowledged his obligations to Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya and said he owed him two great debts one for telling him the day on which he would come to the throne; the other for saving his life. Kum&#225;rap&#225;la left Cambay at midnight, the minister Udayana supplying him with provisions. From Cambay he went to Va&#7789;apadrapura probably Baroda, where feeling hungry he entered the shop of a V&#225;nia named Katuka and asked for parched gram. The V&#225;nia gave the gram and seeing that Kum&#225;rap&#225;la had no money accepted his promise of future payment. From Baroda he came to Bhrigukachh or Broach where he saw a soothsayer and asked him his future. The soothsayer, seeing the bird <hi>kali-dev&#237;</hi> perched on the temple flagstaff, said &#8216;You will shortly be king.&#8217; Kum&#225;rap&#225;la shaved his matted hair and went from Broach to Ujjain where he met his family. But as here too the royal troops followed him he fled to Kolh&#225;pura where he came across a Yog&#237; who foretold his succession to a throne and gave him two spells or <hi>man&#7789;ras</hi>. From Kolh&#225;pura Kum&#225;rap&#225;la went to K&#225;&#241;ch&#237; or Conjeveram and from there to the city of K&#225;lambapattana.<note id="n183.1" n="1">The <corr sic="Kum&#225;rap&#225;laprabanda">Kum&#225;rap&#225;laprabandha</corr> has Kelambapattana and Kolambapattana probably Kolam or Quilon.</note> The king of K&#225;lambapattana Prat&#225;pasim&#803;ha received him like an elder brother and brought him into his city, built a temple of &#346;ivananda Kum&#225;rap&#225;le&#347;vara in his honour, and even issued a coin called a Kum&#225;rap&#225;la. From K&#225;lambapattana Kum&#225;rap&#225;la went to Chitrak&#250;&#7789;a or Chitor and from there to Ujjain whence he took his family to Siddhapura going on alone to A&#7751;ahilapura to see his brother-in-law K&#7771;ish&#7751;adeva. According to the <corr sic="Vich&#225;ra&#347;re&#7751;&#237;">Vich&#225;ra&#347;re&#7751;i</corr> Siddhar&#225;ja died soon after in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1143 on the 3rd of K&#225;rttika &#346;uddha Sam&#803;vat 1199.

 </p><p>In the dissensions that followed the king&#8217;s death Kum&#225;rap&#225;la&#8217;s interests were well served by his brother-in-law K&#7771;ish&#7751;adeva. Eventually the names of three candidates, Kum&#225;rap&#225;la and two others, were laid before the state nobles sitting in council to determine who should be king. Of the three candidates the two others were found wanting, and Kum&#225;rap&#225;la was chosen and installed according to the Vich&#225;ra&#347;re&#7751;i on the 4th of M&#225;rga&#347;&#237;rsha Suddha and according to the Kum&#225;rap&#225;laprabandha on the 4th of M&#225;rga&#347;&#237;rsha Vadhya. At the time of his succession, according to the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i and the Kum&#225;rap&#225;laprabandha, Kum&#225;rap&#225;la was about fifty years of age.

As remonstrance was of no avail the king had K&#7771;ish&#7751;adeva waylaid and beaten by a band of athletes and taken almost dying to his wife the king&#8217;s sister. From this time all the state officers were careful to show ready obedience.

 </p><p>The old ministry saw that under so capable and well served a ruler their power was gone. They accordingly planned to slay the king and place their own nominee on the throne.

After his victory over Ar&#7751;or&#225;ja Kum&#225;rap&#225;la fought, defeated, and, according to the K&#237;rtikaumud&#237;, beheaded Ball&#225;la king of M&#225;lwa who had invaded Gujar&#225;t. The result of this contest seems to have been to reduce M&#225;lwa to its former position of dependence on the A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a kings. More than one inscription of Kum&#225;rap&#225;la&#8217;s found in the temple of Uday&#225;ditya as far north as Udayapura near Bhilsa shows that he conquered the whole of M&#225;lwa, as the inscriptions are recorded by one who calls himself Kum&#225;rap&#225;la&#8217;s general or <hi>da&#7751;&#7693;an&#225;yaka</hi>.<note id="n185.2" n="2">This was a common title of the Sil&#225;h&#225;ra kings.

 </p><p>Another of Kum&#225;rap&#225;la&#8217;s recorded victories is over Mallik&#225;rjuna said to be king of the Konkan who we know from published lists of the North Konkan &#346;il&#225;h&#225;ras flourished about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1160. The author of the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i says this war arose from a bard of king Mallik&#225;rjuna speaking of him before king Kum&#225;rap&#225;la as <hi>R&#225;japit&#225;maha</hi> or grandfather of kings.<note id="n185.3" n="3"><corr sic="&#194;mbada">&#193;mba&#7693;&#225;</corr> is his proper name.

 </p><p>The Kum&#225;rap&#225;lacharita also records a war between Kum&#225;rap&#225;la and Samara king of Sur&#225;sh&#7789;ra or south K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a, the Gujar&#225;t army being commanded by Kum&#225;rap&#225;la&#8217;s minister Udayana.

Udayana came with the army to Vadhw&#225;n, and letting it advance went to P&#225;lit&#225;na. While he was worshipping at P&#225;lit&#225;na, a mouse carried away the burning wick of the lamp. Reflecting on the risk of fire in a wooden temple Udayana determined to rebuild the temple of stone.

Though Ch&#225;ha&#7693;a was known to be extravagant, the king liked him, and after giving him advice placed him in command.

 </p><p>Mr. Forbes<note id="n188.2" n="2">R&#225;s M&#225;l&#225; (New Edition), 154.</note> records the following Br&#225;hmanical tradition of a Mew&#225;&#7693;a queen of Kum&#225;rap&#225;la, which has probably been intentionally omitted by the Jain chroniclers.

 </p><p>Kum&#225;rap&#225;la, says the Br&#225;hman tradition, had wedded a Sisodan&#237; R&#225;ni, a daughter of the house of Mew&#225;&#7693;a. At the time that the sword went for her the Sisodan&#237; heard that the R&#225;ja had made a vow that his wives should receive initiation into the Jain religion at Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya&#8217;s convent before entering the palace. The R&#225;ni refused to start for Patan until she was satisfied she would not be called on to visit the &#193;ch&#225;rya&#8217;s convent. Jayadeva Kum&#225;rap&#225;la&#8217;s household bard became surety and the queen consented to go to A&#7751;ahilapura. Several days after her arrival Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya said to the R&#225;ja &#8216;The Sisodan&#237; R&#225;ni has never come to visit me.&#8217; Kum&#225;rap&#225;la told her she must go. The R&#225;ni refused and fell ill, and the bard&#8217;s wives went to see her. Hearing her story they disguised her as one of themselves and brought her privately home to their house. At night the bard dug a hole in the wall of the city, and taking the R&#225;ni through the hole started with her for Mew&#225;&#7693;a. When Kum&#225;rap&#225;la became aware of the R&#225;ni&#8217;s flight he set off in pursuit with two thousand horse. He came up with the fugitives about fifteen miles from the fort of Idar. The bard said to the R&#225;ni, &#8216;If you can enter Idar you are safe. I have two hundred horse with me.

 </p><p>The Param&#225;ra chiefs of Chandr&#225;vat&#237; near &#193;bu were also feudatories of Kum&#225;rap&#225;la.

The chief of these was the restoring and rebuilding of the great shrine of Some&#347;vara or Soman&#225;tha Patan. According to the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i when Kum&#225;rap&#225;la asked Devas&#250;ri the teacher of Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya how best to keep his name remembered Devas&#250;ri replied: Build a new temple of Soman&#225;tha fit to last an age or <hi>yuga</hi>, instead of the wooden one which is ruined by the ocean billows. Kum&#225;rap&#225;la approved and appointed a building committee or <hi>pa&#241;chakula</hi> headed by a Br&#225;hman named Ga&#7751;&#7693;a Bh&#225;va B&#7771;ihaspati the state officer at Soman&#225;tha. At the instance of Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya the king on hearing the foundations were laid vowed until the temple was finished he would keep apart from women and would take neither flesh nor wine. In proof of his vow he poured a handful of water over N&#237;laka&#7751;&#7789;ha Mah&#225;deva, probably his own royal god. After two years the temple was completed and the flag hoisted. Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya advised the king not to break his vow until he had visited the new temple and paid his obeisance to the god. The king agreed and went to Soman&#225;tha, Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya preceding him on foot and promising to come to Soman&#225;tha after visiting <corr sic="Satru&#241;jaya">&#346;atru&#241;jaya</corr> and Girn&#225;r. On reaching Soman&#225;tha the king was received by Ga&#7751;&#7693;a-B&#7771;ihaspati his head local officer and by the building committee, and was taken in state through the town. At the steps of the temple the king bowed his head to the ground. Under the directions of Ga&#7751;&#7693;a-B&#7771;ihaspati he worshipped the god, made gifts of elephants and other costly articles including his own weight in coin, and returned to A&#7751;ahilapura.

 </p><p>It is interesting to know that the present battered sea-shore temple of Soman&#225;tha, whose <hi>garbh&#225;g&#225;ra</hi> or shrine has been turned into a mosque and whose spire has been shattered, is the temple of whose building and consecration the above details are preserved. This is shown by the style of the architecture and sculpture which is in complete agreement with the other buildings of the time of Kum&#225;rap&#225;la.<note id="n189.2" n="2">It is also interesting, if there is a foundation of fact to the tale, that this is the temple visited by the Persian poet Sa&#225;di (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1200&#8211;1230) when he saw the ivory idol of Soman&#225;tha whose arms were raised by a hidden priest pulling a cord. According to Sa&#225;di on pretence of conversion he was admitted behind the shrine, discovered the cord-puller, threw him into a well, and fled. Compare Journal Royal Asiatic Society Bengal VII.&#8211;2 pages 885&#8211;886. That Sa&#225;di ever visited Soman&#225;tha is doubtful. No ivory human image can ever have been the chief object of worship at Soman&#225;tha.</note>

Time after time no sooner had the invader passed than the work of repair began afresh. One of the most notable restorations was by Kheng&#225;r IV. (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1279&#8211;1333) a <corr sic="Chud&#225;sam&#225;">Ch&#250;&#7693;&#225;sam&#225;</corr> king of Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h who is mentioned in two Girn&#225;r inscriptions as the repairer of Soman&#225;tha after its desecration by <corr sic="Ala-ud-din">Al&#225;-ud-d&#237;n</corr> Khilji.

Since then no attempt has been made to win back the god into his old home.

 </p><p>In the side wall near the door of the little shrine of Bhadrak&#225;li in Patan a broken stone inscription gives interesting details of the temple of Soman&#225;tha. Except that the right hand corners of some of the lines are broken, the inscription is clear and well preserved. It is dated <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1169 (Valabhi 850). It records that the temple of the god Some&#347;a was first of gold built by Soma; next it was of silver built by R&#225;vana; afterwards of wood built by <corr sic="Krishna">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</corr>; and last of stone built by Bh&#237;madeva. The next restoration was through Ga&#7751;&#7693;a-B&#7771;ihaspati under Kum&#225;rap&#225;la. Of Ga&#7751;&#7693;a-B&#7771;ihaspati it gives these details. He was a Kany&#225;kubja or Kanoj Br&#225;hman of the P&#225;&#347;upata school, a teacher of the M&#225;lwa kings, and a friend of Siddhar&#225;ja Jayasim&#803;ha. He repaired several other temples and founded several other religious buildings in Soman&#225;tha. He also repaired the temple of Ked&#225;re&#347;vara in Kumaon on learning that the Kha&#347;a king of that country had allowed it to fall into disrepair. After the time of Kum&#225;rap&#225;la the descendants of Ga&#7751;&#7693;a-B&#7771;ihaspati remained in religious authority in Soman&#225;tha.

 </p><p>Kum&#225;rap&#225;la made many Jain benefactions.<note id="n190.1" n="1">From the Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i and the Kum&#225;rap&#225;lacharita.</note> He repaired the temple of S&#225;gala-Vasahik&#225; at Stambha-t&#237;rtha or Cambay where Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya received his initiation or <hi>d&#237;ksh&#225;</hi>. In honour of the lady who gave him barley flour and curds he built a temple called the Karambaka-Vih&#225;ra in Patan. He also built in Patan a temple called the Mouse or Mushaka-Vih&#225;ra to free himself from the impurity caused by killing a mouse while digging for treasure. At Dhandhuka Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya&#8217;s birthplace a temple called the Jholik&#225;-Vih&#225;ra or cradle temple was built. Besides these Kum&#225;rap&#225;la is credited with building 1444 temples.

 </p><p>Though Kum&#225;rap&#225;la was not a learned man, his ministers were men of learning, and he continued the practice of keeping at his court scholars especially Sanskrit poets. Two of his leading Pandits were R&#225;machandra and Udayachandra both of them Jains. R&#225;machandra is often mentioned in Gujar&#225;ti literature and appears to have been a great scholar. He was the author of a book called the Hundred Accounts or Prabandha&#347;ata. After Udayana&#8217;s death Kum&#225;rap&#225;la&#8217;s chief minister was Kapardi a man of learning skilled in Sanskrit poetry. And all through his reign his principal adviser <pb id="pb191" n="191"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter II.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Chaulukyas, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;961&#8211;1242.</hi></item><item>Kum&#225;rap&#225;la, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1143&#8211;1174.</item></list> </fw>was Hemachandra or Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya probably the most learned man of his time. Though Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya lived during the reigns both of Siddhar&#225;ja and of Kum&#225;rap&#225;la, only under Kum&#225;rap&#225;la did he enjoy political power as the king&#8217;s companion and religious adviser. What record remains of the early Solan&#775;kis is chiefly due to Hemachandra.

 </p><p>The Jain life of Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya abounds in wonders. Apart from the magic and mystic elements the chief details are: Ch&#225;chiga a Modh V&#225;nia of Dhandhuka<note id="n191.1" n="1">The head-quarters of the Dhandhuka sub-division sixty miles south-west of Ahmad&#225;b&#225;d.</note> in the district of Ardh&#225;sh&#7789;ama had by his wife P&#225;hin&#237;<note id="n191.2" n="2">Another reading is L&#225;hin&#237;.</note> of the Ch&#225;mu&#7751;&#7693;a <hi><corr sic="g&#242;tra">gotra</corr></hi>, a boy named Ch&#225;ngodeva who was born <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1089 (Kartik fullmoon Sam&#803;vat 1145). A Jain priest named Devachandra &#193;ch&#225;rya (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1078&#8211;1170; <abbr>S.</abbr> 1134&#8211;1226) came from Patan to Dhandhuka and when in Dhandhuka went to pay his obeisance at the Modh Vasahik&#225;. While Devachandra was seated Ch&#225;ngodeva came playing with other boys and went and sat beside the <hi>&#225;ch&#225;rya</hi>. Struck with the boy&#8217;s audacity and good looks the <hi>&#225;ch&#225;rya</hi> went with the council of the village to Ch&#225;chiga&#8217;s house. Ch&#225;chiga was absent but his wife being a Jain received the <hi>&#225;ch&#225;rya</hi> with respect. When she heard that her son was wanted by the council, without waiting to consult her husband, she handed the boy to the <hi>&#225;ch&#225;rya</hi> who carried him off to Kar&#7751;&#225;vat&#237; and kept him there with the sons of the minister Udayana. Ch&#225;chiga, disconsolate at the loss of his son, went in quest of him vowing to eat nothing till the boy was found. He came to Kar&#7751;&#225;vat&#237; and in an angry mood called on the <hi>&#225;ch&#225;rya</hi> to restore him his son. Udayana was asked to interfere and at last persuaded Ch&#225;chiga to let the boy stay with Devachandra.

 </p><p>In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1097, when Ch&#225;ngodeva was eight years old Ch&#225;chiga celebrated his son&#8217;s consecration or <hi>d&#237;ksh&#225;</hi> and gave him the name of Somachandra. As the boy became extremely learned Devachandra changed his name to Hemachandra the Moon of gold. In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1110 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1166) at the age of 21, his mastery of all the &#346;&#225;stras and Siddh&#225;ntas was rewarded by the dignity of S&#250;ri or sage. Siddhar&#225;ja was struck with his conversation and honoured him as a man of learning. Hemachandra&#8217;s knowledge<corr>,</corr> wisdom and tact enabled him to adhere openly to his Jain rules and beliefs though Siddhar&#225;ja&#8217;s dislike of Jain practices was so great as at times to amount to insult. After one of their quarrels Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya kept away from the king for two or three days. Then the king seeing his humility and his devotion to his faith repented and apologised. The two went together to Soman&#225;tha Patan and there Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya paid his obeisance to the <hi>lin&#775;ga</hi> in a way that did not offend his own faith. During Siddhar&#225;ja&#8217;s reign Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya wrote his well known grammar with aphorisms or <hi>s&#250;tras</hi> and commentary or <hi>v&#7771;itti</hi> called Siddha-Hemachandra, a title compounded of the king&#8217;s name and his own. As the Br&#225;hmans found fault with the absence of any detailed references to the king in the work Hemachandra <pb id="pb192" n="192"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter II.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Chaulukyas, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;961&#8211;1242.</hi></item><item>Kum&#225;rap&#225;la, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1143&#8211;1174.</item></list> </fw>added one verse at the end of each chapter in praise of the king. During Siddhar&#225;ja&#8217;s reign he also wrote two other works, the Haim&#237;n&#225;mam&#225;l&#225;, &#8220;String of Names composed by Hema(chandra)&#8221; or Abhidh&#225;nachint&#225;ma&#7751;i and the Anek&#225;rthan&#225;mam&#225;l&#225;<corr>,</corr> a Collection of words of more than one meaning. He also began the Dvy&#225;&#347;rayakosha<note id="n192.1" n="1"><corr sic="Prabandhachintama&#7751;i">Prabandhachint&#225;ma&#7751;i</corr>.</note> or Double Dictionary being both a grammar and a history. In spite of his value to Kum&#225;rap&#225;la, in the beginning of Kum&#225;rap&#225;la&#8217;s reign Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya was not honoured as a spiritual guide and had to remain subordinate to Br&#225;hmans. When Kum&#225;rap&#225;la asked him what was the most important religious work he could perform Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya advised the restoring of the temple of Soman&#225;tha. Still Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya so far won the king to his own faith that till the completion of the temple he succeeded in persuading the king to take the vow of <hi>ahim&#775;s&#225;</hi> or non-killing which though common to both faiths is a specially Jain observance. Seeing this mark of his ascendancy over the king, the king&#8217;s family priest and other Br&#225;hmans began to envy and thwart Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya. On the completion of the temple, when the king was starting for Soman&#225;tha for the installation ceremony, the Br&#225;hmans told him that Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya did not mean to go with him. Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya who had heard of the plot had already accepted the invitation. He said being a recluse he must go on foot, and that he also wanted to visit Girn&#225;r, and from Girn&#225;r would join the king at Soman&#225;tha. His object was to avoid travelling in a palanquin with the king or suffering a repetition of Siddhar&#225;ja&#8217;s insult for not accepting a <hi>p&#225;lk&#237;</hi>. Soon after reaching Soman&#225;tha Kum&#225;rap&#225;la asked after Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya. The Br&#225;hmans spread a story that he had been drowned, but Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya was careful to appear in the temple as the king reached it. The king saw him, called him, and took him with him to the temple. Some Br&#225;hmans told the king that the Jain priest would not pay any obeisance to <corr sic="Siva">&#346;iva</corr>, but Hem&#225;ch&#225;rya saluted the god in the following verse in which was nothing contrary to strict Jainism: &#8216;Salutation to him, whether he be Brahma, <corr sic="Vishnu">Vish&#7751;u</corr>, Hara, or Jina, from whom have fled desires which produce the sprouts of the seed of worldliness.&#8217;<note id="n192.2" n="2"><p><q><text><body><lg type="Group"><l><foreign lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">&#2349;&#2357;&#2357;&#2368;&#2332;&#2366;&#2329;&#2381;&#2325;&#2369;&#2352;&#2332;&#2344;&#2344;&#2366; &#2352;&#2366;&#2327;&#2366;&#2342;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2307; &#2325;&#2381;&#2359;&#2351;&#2350;&#2369;&#2346;&#2366;&#2327;&#2340;&#2366; &#2351;&#2360;&#2381;&#2351; &#2404;</foreign>     </l><l><foreign lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">&#2348;&#2381;&#2352;&#2361;&#2381;&#2350;&#2366; &#2357;&#2366; &#2357;&#2367;&#2359;&#2381;&#2339;&#2369;&#2352;&#2381;&#2357;&#2366; &#2361;&#2352;&#2379; &#2332;&#2367;&#2344;&#2379; &#2357;&#2366; &#2344;&#2350;&#2360;&#2381;&#2340;&#2360;&#2381;&#2350;&#2376; &#2405;</foreign>     </l><l><foreign lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">&#2351;&#2340;&#2381;&#2352; &#2340;&#2340;&#2381;&#2352; &#2360;&#2350;&#2351;&#2375; &#2351;&#2341;&#2366; &#2340;&#2341;&#2366; &#2351;&#2379;&#2360;&#2367; &#2360;&#2379;&#2360;&#2381;&#2351;&#2349;&#2367;&#2343;&#2351;&#2366; &#2351;&#2351;&#2366; &#2340;&#2351;&#2366; &#2404;</foreign>     </l><l><foreign lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">&#2357;&#2368;&#2340;&#2342;&#2379;&#2359;&#2325;&#2354;&#2369;&#2359;&#2307; &#2360; &#2330;&#2375;&#2342;&#2381;&#2349;&#2357;&#2366;&#2344;&#2375;&#2325; &#2319;&#2357; &#2349;&#2327;&#2357;&#2344;&#2381;&#2344;&#2350;&#2379;&#2360;&#2381;&#2340;&#2369; &#2340;&#2375; &#2405;</foreign> </l></lg></body></text></q></p></note> After this joint visit to Soman&#225;tha Hemachandra gained still more ascendancy over the king, who appreciated his calmness of mind and his forbearance. The Br&#225;hmans tried to prevent the growth of his influence, but in the end Hemachandra overcame them. He induced the king to place in the sight of his Br&#225;hmanical family priests an image of &#346;&#225;ntin&#225;tha T&#237;rthan&#775;kara among his family gods. He afterwards persuaded Kum&#225;rap&#225;la publicly to adopt the Jain faith by going to the hermitage of Hemachandra and giving <pb id="pb193" n="193"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter II.</item><item><hi rend="sc">The Chaulukyas, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;961&#8211;1242.</hi></item><item>Kum&#225;rap&#225;la, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1143&#8211;1174.</item></list> </fw>numerous presents to Jain ascetics. Finally under his influence Kum&#225;rap&#225;la put away all Br&#225;hmanical images from his family place of worship. Having gone such lengths Kum&#225;rap&#225;la began to punish the Br&#225;hmans who insulted Hemachandra. A Br&#225;hman named V&#225;mar&#225;&#347;i, a Pandit at the royal court, who composed a verse insulting Hemachandra, lost his annuity and was reduced to beggary, but on apologising to Hemachandra the annuity was restored. Another Br&#225;hmanical officer named Bh&#225;va B&#7771;ihaspati, who was stationed at Soman&#225;tha, was re-called for insulting Hemachandra. But he too on apologising to Hemachandra was restored to Soman&#225;tha. Under Hemachandra&#8217;s influence Kum&#225;rap&#225;la gave up the use of flesh and wine, ceased to take pleasure in the chase, and by beat of drum forbade throughout his kingdom the taking of animal life. He withdrew their licenses from hunters<corr>,</corr> fowlers and fishermen, and forced them to adopt other callings. To what lengths this dread of life-taking was carried appears from an order that only filtered water was to be given to all animals employed in the royal army. Among the stories told of the king&#8217;s zeal for life-saving is one of a Bania of S&#225;mbhar who having been caught killing a louse was brought in chains to A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a, and had his property confiscated and devoted to the building at A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a of a Louse Temple or Y&#250;k&#225;-Vih&#225;ra. According to another story a man of Nador in M&#225;rw&#225;r was put to death by Kelhana the chief of Nador to appease Kum&#225;rap&#225;la&#8217;s wrath at hearing that the man&#8217;s wife had offered flesh to a field-god or <hi>kshetrap&#225;la</hi>. Hemachandra also induced the king to forego the claim of the state to the property of those who died without a son.

 </p><p>During Kum&#225;rap&#225;la&#8217;s reign Hemachandra wrote many well known Sanskrit and Prakrit works on literature and religion. Among these are the Adhy&#225;tmopanishad or Yoga&#347;&#225;stra a work of 12,000 verses in twelve chapters called Prak&#225;&#347;as, the Tris&#225;sh&#7789;his&#225;l&#225;k&#225;purushacharitra or lives of sixty-three Jain saints of the Utsarpin&#237; and Avasarpin&#237; ages; the Pari&#347;ish&#7789;aparvan, a work of 3500 verses being the life of Jain Sthaviras who flourished after Mah&#225;v&#237;ra; the Pr&#225;k&#7771;ita &#346;abd&#225;nu&#347;&#225;sana or Pr&#225;krit grammar; the Dvy&#225;&#347;raya<note id="n193.1" n="1"><foreign lang="sa" xml:lang="sa">&#2360;&#2306;&#2357;&#2340;&#2381;&#8204; &#2407;&#2408;&#2408;&#2415; &#2357;&#2376;&#2358;&#2366;&#2326;&#2358;&#2369;&#2342;&#2367; &#2409; &#2360;&#2379;&#2350;&#2375; &#2309;&#2342;&#2381;&#2351;&#2375;&#2361; &#2358;&#2381;&#2352;&#2368;&#2350;&#2342;&#2339;&#2361;&#2367;&#2354;&#2381;&#2354;&#2346;&#2359;&#2381;&#2336;&#2325;&#2375; &#2360;&#2350;&#2360;&#2381;&#2340;&#2352;&#2332;&#2366;&#2357;&#2354;&#2368;&#2357;&#2367;&#2352;&#2366;&#2332;&#2367;&#2340;&#2350;&#2361;&#2366;&#2352;&#2366;&#2332;&#2366;&#2343;&#2367;&#2352;&#2366;&#2332;&#2346;&#2352;&#2350;&#2375;&#2358;&#2381;&#2357;&#2352; &#2309;&#2332;&#2351;&#2346;&#2366;&#2354;&#2342;&#2375;&#2357;&#2325;&#2354;&#2381;&#2351;&#2366;&#2339;&#2357;&#2367;&#2332;&#2351;&#2352;&#2366;&#2332;&#2381;&#2351;&#2375; &#2340;&#2340;&#2381;&#2346;&#2366;&#2342;&#2346;&#2342;&#2381;&#2350;&#2379;&#2346;&#2332;&#2368;&#2357;&#2367;&#2344;&#2367; &#2350;&#2361;&#2366;&#2350;&#2366;&#2340;&#2381;&#2351;&#2358;&#2381;&#2352;&#2368;&#2360;&#2379;&#2350;&#2375;&#2358;&#2381;&#2357;&#2352;&#2375; &#2358;&#2381;&#2352;&#2368;&#2325;&#2352;&#2339;&#2366;&#2342;&#2380;.</foreign></note> a Prakrit poem written with the double object of teaching grammar and of giving the history of Kum&#225;rap&#225;la; the Chhandonu&#347;&#225;sana a work of about 6000 verses on prosody; the Lin&#775;g&#225;nu&#347;&#225;sana a work on genders; the De&#347;&#237;n&#225;mam&#225;l&#225; in Prakrit with a commentary a work on local and provincial words; and the Alan&#775;k&#225;rach&#250;&#7693;&#225;ma&#7751;i a work on rhetoric. Hemachandra died in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1172 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1229) at the age of 84. The king greatly mourned his loss and marked his brow with Hemachandra&#8217;s ashes. Such crowds came to share in the ashes of the pyre that the ground was hollowed into a pit known as the Haima-Khadda or Hema&#8217;s Pit.

 </p><p>Kum&#225;rap&#225;la lived to a great age.

Another story given by the Kum&#225;rap&#225;laprabandha is that Kum&#225;rap&#225;la was imprisoned by his nephew and successor Ajayap&#225;la. The Kum&#225;rap&#225;laprabandha gives the exact length of Kum&#225;rap&#225;la&#8217;s reign at 30 years 8 months and 27 days. If the beginning of Kum&#225;rap&#225;la&#8217;s reign is placed at the 4th Magsar Sud Sam&#803;vat 1299, the date of the close, taking the year to begin in K&#225;rtika, would be Bh&#225;drapada &#346;uddha Sam&#803;vat 1229. If with Gujar&#225;t almanacs the year is taken to begin in &#193;sh&#225;&#7693;ha, the date of the close of the reign would be Bh&#225;drapada of Sam&#803;vat 1230. It is doubtful whether either Sam&#803;vat 1229 or 1230 is the correct year, as an inscription dated Sam&#803;vat 1229 Vaish&#225;kha &#346;uddha 3rd at Udayapura near Bhils&#225; describes Ajayap&#225;la Kum&#225;rap&#225;la&#8217;s successor as reigning at A&#7751;ahilapura.

Another curious saying of Tod&#8217;s (Ditto, 182) also remains doubtful. Kum&#225;rap&#225;la expelled the tribe of L&#225;r from his kingdom.

We learn from various grants made by Bh&#237;madeva II. (Ind. Ant VI. 195, 198, 200, 201) that M&#250;lar&#225;ja&#8217;s regular epithet in the <hi>Vam&#803;&#347;&#225;val&#237;</hi> was &#8220;He who overcame in battle the ruler of the Garjjanakas, who are hard to defeat&#8221;: and Dr. B&#252;hler has pointed out (Ditto, 201) that Garjjanaka is a Sanskritising of the name Ghaznavi. As a matter of fact, however, the leader of the Musalm&#225;n army was Muhammad of Ghor, and the battle took place in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1178 (H. 574). One of the two Muhammadan writers who mentions the invasion (Muhammad &#8217;Ufi, who wrote at Delhi about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1211) says that Muhammad was at first defeated, but invaded the country a second time two years later &#8220;and punished the people for their previous misconduct.&#8221; But this is only mentioned incidentally as part of an anecdote of Muhammad&#8217;s equity, and there is some confusion with Muhammad&#8217;s victory in the second battle of N&#225;r&#225;yan (in Jaipur territory) in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1192, as a better, though slightly later authority, Minh&#225;j-us-Sir&#225;j, speaks of no second expedition to Gujar&#225;t led by Muhammad himself. Minh&#225;j-us-Sir&#225;j&#8217;s account of the defeat is as follows (Elliott, II. 294): He (Muhammad) conducted his army by way of Uch and Mult&#225;n towards Nahrw&#225;l&#225;. The R&#225;&#237; of Nahrw&#225;l&#225;, Bh&#237;mdeo, was a minor, but he had a large army and many elephants. In the day of battle the Muhammadans were defeated and the Sult&#225;n was compelled to retreat. This happened in the year 574 H. (1178 <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>)&#8221;. Further on we read (Elliott, II. 300): &#8220;In 593 H. (1197 <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>) he (Muhammad&#8217;s general <corr sic="Kutb-ud-din">Kutb-ud-d&#237;n</corr>) went towards Nahrw&#225;l&#225;, defeated R&#225;&#237; Bh&#237;mdeo, and took revenge on the part of the Sult&#225;n.&#8221; As no conquest of the country is spoken of, this expedition was evidently a mere raid. The only inaccuracy in the account is the mention of Bh&#237;ma instead of M&#250;lar&#225;ja as the king who defeated the first invasion.&#8212;(A. M. T.

 </p><p>Bh&#237;ma was nicknamed Bholo the Simpleton. The chroniclers of this period mention only the V&#225;ghel&#225;s and almost pass over Bh&#237;ma. The author of the K&#237;rtikaumud&#237; says &#8216;the kingdom of the young ruler was gradually divided among powerful ministers and provincial chiefs&#8217;; and according to the Suk&#7771;itasank&#237;rtana &#8216;Bh&#237;ma felt great anxiety on account of the chiefs who had forcibly eaten away portions of the kingdom.&#8217; It appears that during the minority, when the central authority was weak, the kingdom was divided among nobles and feudatories, and that Bh&#237;ma proved too weak a ruler to restore the kingly power. Manuscripts and copperplates show that Bh&#237;madeva was ruling at A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a in <abbr>S.</abbr> 1247, 1251, 1261, 1263, and 1264,<note id="n196.5" n="5">Kielhorn&#8217;s and Peterson&#8217;s Reports on Sanskrit Manuscripts.</note> and copperplates dated <abbr>S.</abbr> 1283, <corr sic="1888">1288</corr>, 1295, and 1296 have also been found. Though Bh&#237;ma in name enjoyed a long unbroken reign the verses quoted above show that power rested not with the king but with the nobles. It appears from an inscription that in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1224 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1280) a Ch&#225;lukya noble named Jayantasim&#803;ha was supreme at A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a though he mentions Bh&#237;ma and his predecessors with honour and respect.<note id="n196.6" n="6"><abbr>Ind.

Even after Lava&#7751;apras&#225;da&#8217;s abdication, though his famous minister Vastup&#225;la considered it advisable, V&#237;radhavala refused to take the supreme title. It was not until the accession of V&#237;radhavala&#8217;s son V&#237;saladeva that the head of the V&#225;ghel&#225;s took any higher title than R&#225;&#7751;aka or chieftain. Lava&#7751;apras&#225;da&#8217;s religious adviser or Guru was the poet Some&#347;vara the author of the K&#237;rtikaumud&#237; and of the Vastup&#225;lacharita or Life of Vastup&#225;la, both being biographical accounts of Vastup&#225;la. The leading supporters both of Lava&#7751;apras&#225;da and of V&#237;radhavala were their ministers the two Jain brothers Vastup&#225;la and Tejah&#803;p&#225;la the famous temple-builders on &#193;bu, &#346;atru&#241;jaya, and Girn&#225;r. According to one account Tejah&#803;p&#225;la remained at court, while Vastup&#225;la went as governor to Stambhat&#237;rtha or Cambay where he redressed wrongs and amassed wealth.<note id="n199.2" n="2">According to the K&#237;rtikaumud&#237;, K&#225;thavate&#8217;s Ed. XIV. note 1, under Vastup&#225;la low people ceased to earn money by base means; the wicked turned pale; the righteous prospered. All honestly and securely plied their calling. Vastup&#225;la put down piracy, and, by building platforms, stopped the mingling of castes in milk shops. He repaired old buildings, planted trees, sank wells, laid out parks, and rebuilt the city. All castes and creeds he treated alike.</note>

 </p><p>One of the chief times of peril in Lava&#7751;apras&#225;da&#8217;s reign was the joint attack of the Devagiri Y&#225;dava Singha&#7751;a or Sinha&#7751;a from the south and of four M&#225;rw&#225;r chiefs from the north. Lava&#7751;apras&#225;da and his son V&#237;radhavala in joint command marched south to meet Singha&#7751;a at Broach. While at Broach the V&#225;ghel&#225;s&#8217; position was made still more critical by the desertion of the Godhraha or Godhr&#225; chief to M&#225;lwa and of the L&#225;&#7789;a or south Gujar&#225;t chief to Singha&#7751;a. Still Lava&#7751;apras&#225;da pressed on, attacked Singha&#7751;a, and gave him so crushing a defeat, that, though Lava&#7751;apras&#225;da had almost at once to turn north to meet the <corr sic="M&#225;lw&#225;">M&#225;lwa</corr> army, Singha&#7751;a retired without causing further trouble.<note id="n199.3" n="3">K&#225;thavate&#8217;s K&#237;rtikaumud&#237;, <hi rend="sc">xv</hi>.</note> Some&#347;vara gives no reason for Singha&#7751;a&#8217;s withdrawal beyond the remark &#8216;Deer do not follow the lion&#8217;s path even when the lion has left it.&#8217; The true reason is supplied by a Manuscript called Forms of Treaties.<note id="n199.4" n="4">The use of the date Monday the fullmoon of Vai&#347;akha, Sam&#803;vat 1288 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1232) in the second part of the Forms seems to shew that the work was written in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1232.</note> The details of a treaty between Sinha&#7751;a and Lava&#7751;apras&#225;da under date Sam&#803;vat 1288 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1232) included among the Forms seem to show that the reason why Sinha&#7751;a did not advance was that Lava&#7751;apras&#225;da and his son submitted and concluded an alliance.<note id="n199.5" n="5">Though the object is to give the form of a treaty of alliance, the author could not have used the names <corr sic="Si&#7751;hana">Sinha&#7751;a</corr> and Lava&#7751;apras&#225;da unless such a treaty had been actually concluded between them.

They say when the Musalm&#225;n trader Sayad was arrested at Cambay his wealth was confiscated. V&#237;radhavala claimed all but the dust which he left to Vastup&#225;la. Much of the dust was gold dust and a fire turned to dust more of the Sayad&#8217;s gold and silver treasure. In this way the bulk of the Sayad&#8217;s wealth passed to Vastup&#225;la. This wealth Vastup&#225;la and his brother Tejah&#803;p&#225;la went to bury in Had&#225;laka in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a. In digging they chanced to come across a great and unknown treasure. According to the books the burden of their wealth so preyed on the brothers that they ceased to care for food. Finding the cause of her husband Tejah&#803;p&#225;la&#8217;s anxiety Anupam&#225; said &#8216;Spend your wealth on a hill top. All can see it; no one can carry it away.&#8217; According to the chroniclers it was this advice, approved by their mother and by Vastup&#225;la&#8217;s wife Lalit&#225;dev&#237;, that led the brothers to adorn the summits of &#193;bu, Girn&#225;r, and &#346;atru&#241;jaya with magnificent temples.

 </p><p>The &#346;atru&#241;jaya temple which is dedicated to the twenty-third T&#237;rthan&#775;kara Nemin&#225;tha is dated <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1232 (Sam&#803;vat 1288) and has an inscription by Some&#347;vara, the author of the K&#237;rtikaumud&#237; telling how it was built. The Girn&#225;r temple, also dedicated to Nemin&#225;tha, bears date <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1232 (Sam&#803;vat 1288). The &#193;bu temple, surpassing the others and almost every building in India in the richness and delicacy of its carving, is dedicated to Nemin&#225;tha and dated <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1231 (Sam&#803;vat 1287). Such was the liberality of the brothers that to protect them against the cold mountain air each of their masons had a fire near him to warm himself and a hot dinner cooked for him at the close of the day. The finest carvers were paid in silver equal in weight to the dust chiselled out of their carvings.<note id="n202.1" n="1">K&#225;thavate&#8217;s K&#237;rtikaumud&#237;, xx.; <abbr>J. B. R. A.

 </p><p>The author Some&#347;vara describes how he twice came to the aid of his friend Vastup&#225;la. On one occasion he saved Vastup&#225;la from a prosecution for peculation. The second occasion was more serious. Sim&#803;ha the maternal uncle of king V&#237;saladeva whipped the servant of a Jain monastery. Enraged at this insult to his religion Vastup&#225;la hired a R&#225;jput who cut off Sim&#803;ha&#8217;s offending hand. The crime was proved and Vastup&#225;la was sentenced to death. But according to the Jains the persuasions of Some&#347;vara not only made the king set Vastup&#225;la free, but led him to upbraid his uncle for beating the servant of a Jain monastery. Soon after his release Vastup&#225;la was seized with fever. Feeling the fever to be mortal he started for <corr sic="Satru&#241;jaya">&#346;atru&#241;jaya</corr> but died on the way.

Chiefs of Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h origin were scattered over the rest of the peninsula among whom were the Gohils of Gogo and Piram, and of the sea-washed province which from them derived its name of Gohilv&#225;d.</note>

 </p><p>This whole term of Musalm&#225;n ascendancy, stretching over slightly more than four and a half centuries, may conveniently be divided into three parts. The First, the rule of the early sovereigns of Dehli, lasting a few years more than a century, or, more strictly from <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1297 to <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1403; the Second, the rule of the &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d kings, a term of nearly a century and three-quarters, from <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1403 to <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1573; the Third, the rule of the Mughal Emperors, when, for little less than two hundred years, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1573&#8211;1760, Gujar&#225;t was administered by viceroys of the court of Dehli.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Territorial Limits.</note>In the course of these 450 years the limits of Gujar&#225;t varied greatly. In the fourteenth century the territory nominally under the control of the Musalm&#225;n governors of P&#225;tan (<corr sic="A&#7751;ahil&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a</corr>) extended southwards from Jh&#225;lor, about fifty miles north of Mount Abu, to the neighbourhood of Bombay, and in breadth from the line of the M&#225;lwa and Kh&#225;ndesh hills to the western shores of peninsular Gujar&#225;t.<note id="n207.1" n="1">The first notice of the exercise of sovereignty by the Musalm&#225;n rulers of Gujar&#225;t over lands further south than the neighbourhood of Surat is in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1428, when king &#193;hmed I.

As no record remains of a Musalm&#225;n conquest of the coast as far south as Danda R&#225;japuri or Janjira, about fifty miles south of Bombay, it seems probable that the North Konkan fell to the Musalm&#225;ns in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1297 as part of the recognised territories of the lords of <corr sic="Anahilapura">A&#7751;ahilapura</corr> (P&#225;tan).

Afterwards, during the latter part of the fifteenth and the beginning of the sixteenth centuries (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1450&#8211;1530), the dominions of the &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d kings gradually spread till they included large tracts to the east and north-east formerly in the possession of the rulers of Kh&#225;ndesh and M&#225;lwa. Still later, during the years of misrule between <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1530 and <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1573, the west of Kh&#225;ndesh and the north of the Konkan ceased to form part of the kingdom of Gujar&#225;t. Finally, under the arrangements introduced by the emperor Akbar in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1583, more lands were restored to M&#225;lwa and Kh&#225;ndesh.

During the early years of Musalm&#225;n rule, the peninsula, together with a small portion of the adjoining mainland, was known as Sorath, a shortened form of <corr sic="Saur&#226;shtra">Saur&#226;sh&#7789;ra</corr>, the name originally applied by the Hindus to a long stretch of sea-coast between the banks of the Indus and Daman.<note id="n208.1" n="1">The details of Akbar&#8217;s settlement in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1583 show Sorath with sixty-three subdivisions and Nav&#225;nagar (Isl&#225;mnagar) with seventeen.

For the author of the Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi, writing as late as the middle of the eighteenth century (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1756: <hi rend='sc'>a.h.</hi>&#160;1170), speaks of Sorath as divided into five districts or <hi>zill&#225;hs</hi>, H&#225;l&#225;r, K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a, Gohilv&#225;&#7693;a, B&#225;bri&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a, and Jetv&#225;&#7693;a, and notices that though Nav&#225;nagar was considered a separate district, its tribute was included in the revenue derived from Sorath.<note id="n208.2" n="2">Bird&#8217;s History of Gujar&#225;t, 418.</note> In another passage the same writer thus defines <corr sic="Saur&#225;shtra">Saur&#225;sh&#7789;ra</corr>:

The name he gives in Sorath is N&#225;gher or N&#225;gh&#237;r which he says is also called S&#225;lgogah.

 </p><p><note place="margin">K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a.</note>The name K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a is of recent origin. It was not until after the establishment of Musalm&#225;n power in Gujar&#225;t that any portion of the peninsula came to bear the name of the tribe of K&#225;this. Even as late as the middle of the eighteenth century, the name K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a was applied only to one of the sub-divisions of the peninsula. In the disorders which prevailed during the latter part of the eighteenth century, the K&#225;this made themselves conspicuous. As it was from the hardy horsemen of this tribe that the tribute-exacting Mar&#225;th&#225;s met with the fiercest resistance, they came to speak of the whole peninsula as the land of the K&#225;this. This use was adopted by the early British officers and has since continued.

 </p><p><note place="margin"><hi rend="sc">Under the kings</hi>, 1403&#8211;1573.</note>Under the &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d kings, as it still is under British rule, Gujar&#225;t was divided politically into two main parts; one, called the <hi>kh&#225;lsah</hi> or crown domain administered directly by the central authority; the other, on payment of tribute in service or in money, left under the control of its former rulers. The amount of tribute paid by the different chiefs depended, not on the value of their territory, but on the terms granted to them when they agreed to become feudatories of the kings of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. Under the Gujar&#225;t Sult&#225;ns this tribute was occasionally collected by military expeditions headed by the king in person and called <hi>mulkg&#237;ri</hi> or country-seizing circuits.

 </p><p><note place="margin">States.</note>The internal management of the feudatory states was unaffected by their payment of tribute. Justice was administered and the revenue collected in the same way as under the <corr sic="Anahilapur">A&#7751;ahilapur</corr> kings. The revenue consisted, as before, of a share of the crops received in kind, supplemented by the levy of special cesses, trade, and transit dues. The chief&#8217;s share of the crops differed according to the locality; it rarely exceeded one-third of the produce, it rarely fell short of one-sixth. From some parts the chief&#8217;s share was realised directly from the cultivator by agents called <hi>mantris</hi>; from other parts the collection was through superior landowners.<note id="n209.1" n="1">R&#225;s M&#225;la, I. 241.</note>

 </p><p><note place="margin">Districts.</note>The &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d kings divided the portion of their territory which was under their direct authority into districts or <hi>sark&#225;rs</hi>. These districts were administered in one of two ways. They were either assigned to nobles in support of a contingent of troops, or they were set apart as crown domains and managed by paid officers. The officers placed in charge of districts set apart as <note place="margin">Crown Lands.</note>crown domains were called <hi>mukti&#259;</hi>.<note id="n209.2" n="2">Makta&#259; and <hi>ikt&#225;&#259;</hi>, the district administered by a <hi>mukti&#259;</hi>, come from the Arabic root <hi>kata&#225;</hi>, he cut, in allusion to the public revenue or the lands cut and apportioned for the pay of the officers and their establishments.</note> Their chief duties were to preserve the peace and to collect the revenue. For the maintenance of order, a body of soldiers from the army head-quarters at &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d was detached for service in each of these divisions, and placed under the command of the district governor. At the same time, in addition to the presence of this detachment of regular troops, every district contained certain <pb id="pb210" n="210"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Introduction.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Under the kings</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1403&#8211;1573.</item></list> </fw>fortified outposts called <hi>th&#225;n&#225;s</hi>, varying in number according to the character of the country and the temper of the people. These posts were in charge of officers called <hi>th&#225;nad&#225;rs</hi> subordinate to the district governor. They were garrisoned by bodies of local soldiery, for whose maintenance, in addition to money payments, a small assignment of land was set apart in the neighbourhood of the post. On the arrival of the tribute-collecting army the governors of the districts through which it passed were expected to join the main body with their local contingents. At other times the district governors had little control over the feudatory chiefs in the neighbourhood of their charge.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Fiscal.</note>For fiscal purposes each district or <hi>sark&#225;r</hi> was distributed among a certain number of sub-divisions or <hi>pargan&#225;hs</hi>, each under a paid official styled <hi>&#225;mil</hi> or <hi>tahsild&#225;r</hi>. These sub-divisional officers realised the state demand, nominally one-half of the produce, by the help of the headmen of the villages under their charge. In the sharehold and simple villages of North Gujar&#225;t these village headmen were styled <hi>patels</hi> or according to Musalm&#225;n writers <hi>mukaddams</hi> and in the simple villages of the south they were known as <hi>des&#225;is</hi>. They arranged for the final distribution of the total demand in joint villages among the shareholders, and in simple villages from the individual cultivators.<note id="n210.1" n="1">Further particulars regarding these village headmen are given below.</note> The sub-divisional officer presented a statement of the accounts of the villages in his sub-division to the district officer, whose record of the revenue of his whole district was in turn forwarded to the head revenue officer at court. As a check on the internal management of his charge, and especially to help him in the work of collecting the revenue, with each district governor was associated an accountant. Further that each of these officers might be the greater check on the other, king &#193;hmed I. (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1412&#8211;1443) enforced the rule that when the governor was chosen from among the royal slaves the accountant should be a free man, and that when the accountant was a slave the district governor should be chosen from some other class. This practise was maintained till the end of the reign of Muzaffar Sh&#225;h (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1511&#8211;1525), when, according to the Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi, the army became much increased, and the ministers, condensing the details of revenue, farmed it on contract, so that many parts formerly yielding one rupee now produced ten, and many others seven eight or nine, and in no place was there a less increase than from ten to twenty per cent. Many other changes occurred at the same time, and the spirit of innovation creeping into the administration the wholesome system of checking the accounts was given up and mutiny and confusion spread over Gujar&#225;t.<note id="n210.2" n="2">Bird&#8217;s History of Gujar&#225;t, 192; Mir&#259;t-i-Sikandari, Persian Text, 44.</note>

 </p><p><note place="margin">Assigned Lands.</note>The second class of directly governed districts were the lands assigned to nobles for the maintenance of contingents of troops. As in other parts of India, it would seem that at first these assignments were for specified sums equal to the pay of the contingent. When such assignments were of long standing, and were large enough to swallow the whole revenue of a district, it was natural to simplify the <pb id="pb211" n="211"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Introduction.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Under the kings</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1403&#8211;1573.</item><item>Assigned Lands.</item></list> </fw>arrangement by transferring the collection of the revenue and the whole management of the district to the military leader of the contingent. So long as the central power was strong, precautions were doubtless taken to prevent the holder of the grant from unduly rackrenting his district and appropriating to himself more than the pay of the troops, or from exercising any powers not vested in the local governors of districts included within the crown domains. As in other parts of India, those stipulations were probably enforced by the appointment of certain civil officers directly from the government to inspect the whole of the noble&#8217;s proceedings, as well in managing his troops as in administering his lands.<note id="n211.1" n="1"><corr sic="Elphistone&#8217;s">Elphinstone&#8217;s</corr> History, 76.</note> The decline of the king&#8217;s power freed the nobles from all check or control in the management of their lands. And when, in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1536, the practice of farming was introduced into the crown domains, it would seem to have been adopted by the military leaders in their lands, and to have been continued till the annexation of Gujar&#225;t by the emperor Akbar in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1573.

 </p><p><note place="margin"><hi rend="sc">Under the Mughals</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1573&#8211;1760.</note>It was the policy of Akbar rather to improve the existing system than to introduce a new form of government. After to some extent contracting the limits of Gujar&#225;t he constituted it a province or <hi>s&#251;bah</hi> of the empire, appointing to its <note place="margin">Administration.</note>government an officer of the highest rank with the title of <hi>s&#251;bahd&#225;r</hi> or viceroy. As was the case under the &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d kings, the province continued to be divided into territories managed by feudatory chiefs, and <note place="margin">Crown Lands.</note>districts administered by officers appointed either by the court of Dehli or by the local viceroy. The head-quarters of the army remained at &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, and detachments were told off and placed under the orders of the officers in charge of the directly administered divisions. These district governors, as before, belonged to two classes, paid officers responsible for the management of the crown domains and military leaders in possession of lands assigned to them in pay of their contingent of troops. The governors of the crown domains, who were now known as <hi>faujd&#225;rs</hi> or commanders, had, in addition to the command of the regular troops, the control of the outposts maintained within the limits of their charge. Like their predecessors they accompanied the viceroy in his yearly circuit for the collection of tribute.

 </p><p>As a check on the military governors and to help them in collecting the revenue, the distinct class of account officers formerly established by king &#193;hmed I. (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1412&#8211;1443) was again introduced. The head of this branch of the administration was an officer, second in rank to the viceroy alone, appointed direct from the court of Dehli with the title of <hi>div&#225;n</hi>. Besides acting as collector-general of the revenues of the province, this officer was also the head of its civil administration. His title <hi>div&#225;n</hi> is generally translated minister. And though the word minister does not express the functions of the office, which corresponded more nearly with those of a chief secretary, it represents with sufficient accuracy the relation in which the holder of the office of <hi>div&#225;n</hi> generally stood to the viceroy.

In the leading ports the <hi>&#225;mil</hi> of the customs was called <hi>mutasaddi</hi> that is civil officer.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Village Officers.</note>The <hi>&#225;mil</hi> or <hi>m&#225;mlatd&#225;r</hi> dealt directly with the village officials, namely with the <hi>mukaddam</hi> or headman, the <hi>patw&#225;ri</hi> or lease manager, the <hi>k&#225;n&#250;ngo</hi> or accountant, and the <hi>hav&#225;ld&#225;r</hi> or grain-yard guardian.

For this, in Akbar&#8217;s time, the <hi>des&#225;i</hi> received a remuneration of 2&#189; per cent on the sum collected. Under the first viceroy M&#237;rza &#193;z&#237;z Kokalt&#225;sh (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1573&#8211;1575) this percentage was reduced to one-half of its former amount, and in later times this one-half was again reduced by one-half. Though the Muhammadan historians give no reason for so sweeping a reduction, the cause seems to have been the inability of the <hi>des&#225;is</hi> to collect the tribute without the aid of a military force. Under the new system the <hi>des&#225;i</hi> seems merely to have kept the accounts of the tribute due, and the records both of the amount which should be levied as tribute and of other customary rights of the crown. In later times the <hi>des&#225;is</hi> were to a great extent superseded by the district accountants or <hi>majmud&#225;rs</hi>, and many <hi>des&#225;is</hi>, especially in south Gujar&#225;t, seem to have sunk to <hi>patels</hi>.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Fiscal.</note>The revenue appears to have been classed under four main heads: 1. The <hi>Khaz&#225;nah-i-&#193;mirah</hi> or imperial treasury which comprehended the land tax received from the crown <hi>pargan&#225;hs</hi> or districts, the tribute, the five per cent customs dues from infidels, the import dues on stuffs, and the <hi>s&#225;yer</hi> or land customs including transit dues, slave market dues, and miscellaneous taxes. 2. The treasury of arrears into which were paid government claims in arrear either from the <hi>&#225;mils</hi> or from the farmers of land revenue; <hi>tak&#225;vi</hi> advances due by the <hi>raiyats</hi>; and tribute levied by the presence of a military force. 3. The treasury of charitable endowments. Into this treasury was paid the 2&#189; per cent levied as customs dues from Muhammadans.<note id="n213.1" n="1"><hi>Zak&#225;t</hi>, literally purification or cleansing, is the name of a tax levied from Muslims for charitable purposes or religious uses. In the endowments-treasury the customs dues from Muslims at 2&#189; per cent (the technical 1 in 40) as contrasted with the five per cent levied from infidels (the technical 2 in 40) were entered. Hence in these accounts <hi>zak&#225;t</hi> corresponds with customs dues, and is divisible into two kinds <hi>khushki zak&#225;t</hi> or land customs and <hi>tari zak&#225;t</hi> or sea customs.</note> The pay of the religious classes was defrayed from this treasury. 4. The treasury, into which the <hi>jaziah</hi> or capitation tax levied from <hi>zimm&#237;s</hi> or infidels who acknowledged Muhammadan rule, was paid. The proceeds were expended in charity and public works. After the death of the emperor Farrukhsiyar (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1713&#8211;1719), this source of revenue was abolished. The arrangements introduced by Akbar in the end of the sixteenth century remained in force till the death of Aurangz&#237;b in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1707. Then trouble and perplexity daily increased, till in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1724&#8211;25, <corr sic="Hamid">Ham&#237;d</corr> Kh&#225;n usurped the government lands, and, seeking to get rid of the servants and assignments, gradually obtained possession of the records of the registry office. The keepers of the records were scattered, and yearly revenue statements ceased to be received from the districts.<note id="n213.2" n="2">Bird&#8217;s History of Gujar&#225;t, 93. Though under the Mughal viceroys the state demand was at first realized in grain, at the last the custom was to assess each sub-division, and probably each village, at a fixed sum or <hi>jama</hi>. The total amount for the sub-division was collected by an officer called <hi>majmud&#225;r</hi>, literally keeper of collections, the village headmen, <hi>patels</hi> or <hi><corr sic="muk&#225;ddams">mukaddams</corr></hi>, being responsible each for his own village.</note>

 </p><p><note place="margin">Assigned Lands.</note>Akbar continued the system of assigning lands to military leaders in payment of their contingents of troops. Immediately after the annexation in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1573, almost the whole country was divided among the great nobles.<note id="n213.3" n="3">Bird&#8217;s History of Gujar&#225;t, 325.</note> Except that the revenues of certain tracts were <pb id="pb214" n="214"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Introduction.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Under the Mughals</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1573&#8211;1760.</item><item>Assigned Lands.</item></list> </fw>set aside for the imperial exchequer the directly governed districts passed into the hands of military leaders who employed their own agents to collect the revenue. During the seventeenth century the practice of submitting a yearly record of their revenues, and the power of the viceroy to bring them to account for misgovernment, exercised a check on the management of the military leaders. And during this time a yearly surplus revenue of &#163;600,000 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 60,00,000) from the assigned and crown lands was on an average forwarded from Gujar&#225;t to Dehli. In the eighteenth century the decay of the viceroy&#8217;s authority was accompanied by the gradually increased power of the military leaders in possession of assigned districts, till finally, as in the case of the Naw&#225;bs of Broach and Surat, they openly claimed the position of independent rulers.<note id="n214.1" n="1">Bird&#8217;s History of Gujar&#225;t, 341.</note>

 </p><p><note place="margin">Minor Offices.</note>Of both leading and minor officials the Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi supplies the following additional details. The highest officer who was appointed under the seal of the minister of the empire was the provincial <hi>div&#225;n</hi> or minister. He had charge of the fiscal affairs of the province and of the revenues of the <hi>kh&#225;lsa</hi> or crown lands, and was in some matters independent of the viceroy. Besides his personal salary he had 150 <hi>saw&#225;rs</hi> for two provincial <hi>th&#225;n&#225;s</hi> Arjanpur and Khamb&#225;lia. Under the <hi>div&#225;n</hi> the chief officers were the <hi>p&#237;shk&#225;r div&#225;n</hi> his first assistant, who was appointed under imperial orders by the patent of the <hi>div&#225;n</hi>, the <hi>daroghah</hi> or head of the office, and the <hi>sharf</hi> or <hi>mushrif</hi> and <hi>tehwild&#225;r</hi> of the <hi>daftar kh&#225;n&#225;hs</hi>, who presided over the accounts with <hi>munshis</hi> and <hi>muharrirs</hi> or secretaries and writers. The <hi>k&#225;zis</hi>, both town and city, with the sanction of the emperor were appointed by the chief law officer of the empire through the chief law officer of the province. They were lodged by the state, paid partly in cash partly in land, and kept up a certain number of troopers. In the <hi><corr sic="k&#225;z&#237;&#8217;s">k&#225;zis&#8217;</corr></hi> courts <hi>wak&#237;ls</hi> or pleaders and <hi>muft&#237;s</hi> or law officers drew 8 as. to Re. 1 a day. Newly converted Musalm&#225;ns also drew 8 as. a day. The city censor or <hi>muhtasib</hi> had the supervision of morals and of weights and measures. He was paid in cash and land, and was expected to keep up sixty troopers. The news-writer, who was sometimes also <hi>bakhshi</hi> or military paymaster, had a large staff of news-writers called <hi>w&#225;ki&#226;h-nig&#225;r</hi> who worked in the district courts and offices as well as in the city courts. He received his news-reports every evening and embodied them in a letter which was sent to court by camel post. A second staff of news-writers called <hi>saw&#225;n&#237;hnig&#225;r</hi> reported rumours. A third set were the <hi>hark&#225;r&#225;s</hi> on the viceroy&#8217;s staff. Postal <hi>chaukis</hi> or stations extended from &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d to the Ajm&#237;r frontier, each with men and horse ready to carry the imperial post which reached Sh&#225;h Jeh&#225;n&#225;b&#225;d or Dehli in seven days. A line of posts also ran south through Broach to the Dakhan. The <hi>faujd&#225;rs</hi> or military police, who were sometimes commanders of a thousand and held estates, controlled both the city and the district police. The <hi>kotw&#225;l</hi> or head of the city night-watch was appointed by the viceroy. He had fifty troopers and a hundred foot. In the treasury department were the <hi>am&#237;n</hi> or chief, the <hi>d&#225;roghah</hi>, the <pb id="pb215" n="215"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Introduction.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Under the Mughals</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1573&#8211;1760.</item><item>Minor Offices.</item></list> </fw><hi>mushrif</hi>, the treasurer, and five messengers.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Land Tenures.</note>Besides the class of vernacular terms that belong to the administration of the province, certain technical words connected with the tenure of land are of frequent occurrence in this history. For each of these, in addition to the English equivalent which as far as possible has been given in the text, some explanation seems necessary. During the period to which this history refers, the superior holders of the land of the province belonged to two main classes, those whose claims dated from before the Musalm&#225;n conquest and those whose interest in the land was based on a Musalm&#225;n grant. By the Musalm&#225;n historians, landholders of the first class, who were all Hindus, are called <hi>zam&#237;nd&#225;rs</hi>, while landholders of the second class, Musalm&#225;ns as a rule, are spoken of as <hi>j&#225;g&#237;rd&#225;rs</hi>. Though the term <hi>zam&#237;nd&#225;r</hi> was used to include the whole body of superior Hindu landholders, in practice a marked distinction was drawn between the almost independent chief, who still enjoyed his Hindu title of <hi>r&#225;ja</hi>, <hi>r&#225;val</hi>, <hi>r&#225;v</hi>, or <hi>j&#225;m</hi>, and the petty claimant to a share in a government village, who in a Hindu state would have been known as a <hi>gar&#225;si&#225;</hi>.<note id="n215.2" n="2">The title <hi>r&#225;ja</hi> is applicable to the head of a family only. The payment of tribute to the Mughals or Mar&#225;th&#225;s does not affect the right to use this title. <hi>R&#225;na</hi> and <hi>r&#225;v</hi> seem to be of the same dignity as <hi>r&#225;ja</hi>. <hi>R&#225;val</hi> is of lower rank. The sons of <hi>r&#225;j&#225;s</hi>, <hi>r&#225;n&#225;s</hi>, <hi>r&#225;vs</hi>, and <hi>r&#225;vals</hi> are called <hi>kuvars</hi> and their sons <hi>th&#225;kurs</hi>.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Hereditary Hindu Landholders.</note>The larger landholders, who had succeeded in avoiding complete subjection, were, as noticed above, liable only for the payment of a certain fixed sum, the collection of which by the central power in later times usually required the presence of a military force. With regard to the settlement of the claims of the smaller landholders of the superior class, whose estates fell within the limits of the directly administered districts, no steps seem to have been taken till the reign of &#193;hmed Sh&#225;h I. (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1411&#8211;1443). About the year <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1420 the peace of his kingdom was so broken by agrarian disturbances, that &#193;hmed Sh&#225;h agreed, on condition of their paying tribute and performing military service, to re-grant to the landholders of the <hi>zam&#237;nd&#225;r</hi> class as hereditary possessions a one-fourth share of their former village lands. The portion so set apart was called <hi>v&#225;nta</hi> or share, and the remainder, retained as state land, was called <hi>talpat</hi>. This agreement continued till, in the year <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1545, during the reign of Mahm&#250;d Sh&#225;h II. (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1536&#8211;1553), an attempt was made to annex these private shares to the crown. This measure caused much discontent and disorder. It was reversed by the emperor Akbar who, as part of the settlement of the province in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1583, restored their one-fourth share to the landholders, and, except that the Mar&#225;th&#225;s <pb id="pb216" n="216"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Introduction.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Under the Mughals</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1573&#8211;1760.</item><item>Hereditary Hindu Landholders.</item></list> </fw>afterwards levied an additional quit-rent from these lands, the arrangements then introduced have since continued in force.<note id="n216.1" n="1">Under the Mar&#225;th&#225;s the title <hi>zam&#237;nd&#225;r</hi> was bestowed on the farmers of the land revenue, and this practice was adopted by the earlier English writers on Gujar&#225;t. In consequence of this change small landholders of the superior class, in directly administered districts, came again to be called by their original Hindu name of <hi>gar&#225;sia</hi>. Mr. Elphinstone (History, 79 and note 13) includes under the term <hi>zam&#237;nd&#225;r:</hi> (1) half-subdued chieftains, (2) independent governors of districts, and (3) farmers of revenue. He also notices that until Aurangz&#237;b&#8217;s time such chiefs as enjoyed some degree of independence were alone called <hi>zam&#237;nd&#225;rs</hi>. But in Colonel Walker&#8217;s time, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1805, at least in Gujar&#225;t (Bombay Government Selections, XXXIX. 25) the term <hi>zam&#237;nd&#225;r</hi> included <hi>des&#225;is</hi>, <hi>majmud&#225;rs</hi> (district accountants), <hi>patels</hi>, and <hi>tal&#225;tis</hi> (village clerks).</note>

 </p><p><note place="margin">Levies.</note>During the decay of Musalm&#225;n rule in Gujar&#225;t in the first half of the eighteenth century, shareholders of the <hi>gar&#225;sia</hi> class in government villages, who were always ready to increase their power by force, levied many irregular exactions from their more peaceful neighbours, the cultivators or inferior landholders. These levies are known as <hi>vol</hi> that is a forced contribution or <hi>p&#225;l</hi> that is protection. All have this peculiar characteristic that they were paid by the cultivators of crown lands to petty marauders to purchase immunity from their attacks. They in no case partook of the nature of dues imposed by a settled government on its own subjects. <hi>Tora gar&#225;s</hi>, more correctly <hi>toda gar&#225;s</hi>, is another levy which had its origin in eighteenth century disorder. It was usually a readymoney payment taken from villages which, though at the time crown or <hi>kh&#225;lsa</hi>, had formerly belonged to the <hi>gar&#225;sia</hi> who exacted the levy. Besides a readymoney payment contributions in kind were sometimes exacted.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Service Lands.</note>The second class of superior landholders were those whose title was based on a Musalm&#225;n grant. Such grants were either assignments of large tracts of land to the viceroy, district-governors, and nobles, to support the dignity of their position and maintain a contingent of troops, or they were allotments on a smaller scale granted in reward for some special service. Land granted with these objects was called <hi>j&#225;g&#237;r</hi>, and the holder of the land <hi>j&#225;g&#237;rd&#225;r</hi>. In theory, on the death of the original grantee, such possessions were strictly resumable; in practice they tended to become hereditary. No regular payments were required from holders of <hi>j&#225;g&#237;rs</hi>. Only under the name of <hi>peshkash</hi> occasional contributions were demanded. These occasional contributions generally consisted of such presents as a horse, an elephant, or some other article of value. They had more of the nature of a freewill offering than of an enforced tribute. Under the Musalm&#225;ns contributions of this kind were the only payments exacted from proprietors of the <hi>j&#225;g&#237;rd&#225;r</hi> class. But the Mar&#225;th&#225;s, in addition to contributions, imposed on <hi>j&#225;g&#237;rd&#225;rs</hi> a regular tribute, similar to that paid by the representatives of the original class of superior Hindu landholders.

Of these devices two seem to have been specially common, the practice of supporting a body of horse smaller than the number agreed for, and the practice of purveyance that is of levying supplies without payment. Sir Thomas Roe, from <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1615 to 1618 English ambassador at the court of the emperor Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r, gives the following details of these irregular practices: &#8216;The P&#225;tan (that is Patna in Bengal) viceroy&#8217;s government was estimated at 5000 horse, the yearly pay of each trooper being &#163;20 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 200), of which he kept only 1500, being allowed the surplus as dead pay. On one occasion this governor wished to present me with 100 loaves of the finest sugar, as white as snow, each loaf weighing fifty pounds. On my declining, he said, &#8216;You refuse these loaves, thinking I am poor; but being made in my government the sugar costs me nothing, as it comes to me gratis.&#8217; Sir Thomas Roe in Kerr&#8217;s Voyages, IX. 282&#8211;284. The same writer, the best qualified of the English travellers of that time to form a correct opinion, thus describes the administration of the Musalm&#225;n governors of the seventeenth century: &#8216;They practise every kind of tyranny against the natives under their jurisdiction, oppressing them with continual exactions, and are exceedingly averse from any way being opened by which the king may be informed of their infamous proceedings. They grind the people under their government to extract money from them, often hanging men up by the heels to make them confess that they are rich, or to ransom themselves from faults merely imputed with a view to fleece them.&#8217; Sir Thomas Roe in Kerr&#8217;s Voyages, IX. 338.</note>

The last kings of A&#7751;ahilapur or P&#225;tan, suffering under the defects of an incomplete title, held even their crown lands with no firmness of grasp, and had allowed the outlying territory to slip almost entirely from their control. Several of the larger and more distant rulers had resumed their independence. The Bh&#237;ls and Kolis of the hills, forests, and rough river banks were in revolt. And stranger chiefs, driven south by the Musalm&#225;n conquests in Upper India, had robbed the central power of much territory.<note id="n217.3" n="3">Of these settlements the principal was that of the R&#225;tho&#7693; chief who in the thirteenth century established himself at &#205;dar, now one of the states of the Mahi K&#225;ntha.

In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1403 when Gujar&#225;t separated from Dehli the new king held but a narrow strip of plain. On the north were the independent chiefs of Sirohi and Jh&#225;lor, from whom he occasionally levied contributions. On the east the R&#225;ja of &#205;dar, another R&#225;jput prince, was in possession of the western skirts of the hills and forests, and the rest of that tract was held by the mountain tribes of Bhils and Kolis. On the west the peninsula was in the hands of nine or ten Hindu tribes, probably tributary, but by no means obedient.<note id="n218.2" n="2">Elphinstone&#8217;s History, 762.</note> In the midst of so unsettled and warlike a population, all the efforts of Muzaffar I., the founder of the dynasty, were spent in establishing his power. It was not until the reign of his successor &#193;hmed I. (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1412&#8211;1443) that steps were taken to settle the different classes of the people in positions of permanent order. About the year <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1420 two important measures were introduced. Of these one assigned lands for the support of the troops, and the other recognised the rights of the superior class of Hindu landholders to a portion of the village lands they had formerly held. The effect of these changes was to establish order throughout the districts directly under the authority of the crown. And though, in the territories subject to feudatory chiefs, the presence of an armed force was still required to give effect to the king&#8217;s claims for tribute, his increasing power and wealth made efforts at independence more hopeless, and gradually secured the subjection of the greater number of his vassals. During the latter part of the fifteenth and the first quarter of the sixteenth century the power of the &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d kings was at its height. At that time their dominions included twenty-five divisions or <hi>sark&#225;rs</hi>.

Of this total amount the territorial revenue from the twenty-five districts yielded &#163;5,840,000 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 5,84,00,000), or slightly more than one-half. Of the remaining &#163;5,620,000 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 5,62,00,000) about one-fifth part was derived from the Dakhan tribute and the rest from customs-dues.<note id="n219.2" n="2">The passage from the <corr sic="Mir&#259;t i-&#193;hmedi">Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi</corr>, Bird 109, is: &#8216;A sum of 25 <hi>l&#225;khs</hi> of <hi>h&#250;ns</hi> and one <hi>kror</hi> of <hi>ibr&#225;h&#237;ms</hi>, that were two parts greater, being altogether nearly equal to 5 <hi>krors</hi> and 62 <hi>l&#225;khs</hi> of rupees, was collected from the Dakhan tribute and the customs of the European and Arab ports.&#8217; The word <hi>h&#250;n</hi>, from an old Karn&#225;tak word for gold, is the Musalm&#225;n name for the coin known among Hindus as <hi>var&#225;ha</hi> or the wild-boar coin, and among the Portuguese as the <hi>pagoda</hi> or temple coin. Prinsep <abbr>Ind. Ant.</abbr> Thomas&#8217; Ed. II. U. T. 18. The old specimens of this coin weigh either 60 grains the <hi>m&#225;da</hi> or half pagoda, or 120 grains the <hi>h&#250;n</hi> or full pagoda. Thomas, Chron. Pat. Ks. II. 224, note. The star pagoda, in which English accounts at Madras were formerly kept, weighs 52&#183;56 grains, and was commonly valued at 8s. or <abbr>Rs.</abbr> 4 (Prinsep as above). At this rate in the present sum the 25 <hi>l&#225;khs</hi> of <hi>h&#250;ns</hi> would equal one <hi>kror</hi> (100 <hi>l&#225;khs</hi>) of rupees. The <hi>ibr&#225;h&#237;mi</hi>, &#8216;two parts greater than the <hi>h&#250;n</hi>,&#8217; would seem to be a gold coin, perhaps a variety of the Persian <hi>ashrafi</hi> (worth about 9s. English. Marsden, N. O. 455). Taking the two parts of a <hi>h&#250;n</hi> as <hi>f&#225;nams</hi> or sixteenths, this would give the <hi>ibr&#225;h&#237;mi</hi> a value of <abbr>Rs.</abbr> 4&#188;, and make a total customs revenue of 425 <hi>l&#225;khs</hi> of rupees. This statement of the revenues of the kingdom is, according to the author of the Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi, taken from such times as the power of the Gujar&#225;t kings continued to increase. The total revenue of the twenty-five districts (&#163;5,840,000) is the amount recovered in the year <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1571. But the receipts under the head of Tribute must have been compiled from accounts of earlier years. For, as will be seen below, the neighbouring kings ceased to pay tribute after the end of the reign of Bah&#225;dur (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1536). Similarly the customs revenues entered as received from Daman and other places must have been taken from the accounts of some year previous to <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1560.</note>

 </p><p>The buildings at &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, and the ruins of Ch&#225;mp&#225;ner and Mehm&#250;d&#225;b&#225;d, prove how much wealth was at the command of the sovereign and his nobles, while the accounts of travellers seem to show that the private expenditure of the rulers was not greater than the kingdom was well able to bear. The Portuguese traveller Duarte Barbosa, who was in Gujar&#225;t between <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1511 and <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1514, found the capital Ch&#225;mp&#225;ner a great city, in a very fertile country of abundant provisions, with many cows sheep and goats and plenty of fruit, so that it was full of all things.<note id="n219.3" n="3">The remains at Ch&#225;mp&#225;ner in the British district of the Panch Mah&#225;ls are well known. Of Mehm&#250;d&#225;b&#225;d, the town of that name in the district of Kaira, eighteen miles south of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, a few ruins only are left. In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1590 this city is said to have contained many grand edifices surrounded with a wall eleven miles (7 <hi>kos</hi>) square with at every &#190; mile (&#189; <hi>kos</hi>) a pleasure house, and an enclosure for deer and other game. (&#193;in-i-Akbari: Gladwin, II. 64.) The Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi makes no special reference to the sovereign&#8217;s share of the revenue. The greater part of the &#163;5,620,000 derived from <pb/>tribute and customs would probably go to the king, besides the lands specially set apart as crown domains, which in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1571 were returned as yielding a yearly revenue of &#163;900,000 (900,000,000 <hi>tank&#225;s</hi>). This would bring the total income of the crown to a little more than 6&#189; millions sterling.</note> &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d was still larger, very rich and well <pb id="pb220" n="220"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Introduction.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Condition of Gujar&#225;t</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1297&#8211;1760.</item><item>Under the Kings, 1403&#8211;1573.</item></list> </fw>supplied, embellished with good streets and squares, with houses of stone and cement. It was not from the interior districts of the province that the &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d kings derived the chief part of their wealth, but from those lying along the coast, which were enriched by manufactures and commerce.<note id="n220.1" n="1">So Sikandar Lodi emperor of Dehli, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1488&#8211;1517, is reported to have said: &#8216;The magnificence of the kings of Dehli rests on wheat and barley; the magnificence of the kings of Gujar&#225;t rests on coral and pearls.&#8217; Bird, 132.</note> So it was that along the shores of the gulf of Cambay and southward as far as Bombay the limit of the Gujar&#225;t kingdom, besides many small sea-ports, Barbosa chooses out for special mention twelve &#8216;towns of commerce, very rich and of great trade.&#8217; Among these was Diu, off the south coast of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a, yielding so large a revenue to the king as to be &#8216;a marvel and amazement.&#8217; And chief of all Cambay, in a goodly, fertile, and pretty country full of abundant provisions; with rich merchants and men of great prosperity; with craftsmen and mechanics of subtle workmanship in cotton, silk, ivory, silver, and precious stones; the people well dressed, leading luxurious lives, much given to pleasure and amusement.<note id="n220.2" n="2">The twelve Gujar&#225;t ports mentioned by Barbosa are: On the south coast of the peninsula, two: Patenixi (P&#225;tan-Somn&#225;th, now Ver&#225;val), very rich and of great trade; Surati-Mangalor (Mangrul), a town of commerce, and Diu. On the shores of the gulf of Cambay four: Gogari (Gogha), a large town; Barbesy (Broach); Guand&#225;ri or Gandar (Gandh&#225;r), a very good town; and Cambay. On the western coast five: Ravel (R&#225;nder), a rich place; Surat, a city of very great trade; Denvy (Gandevi), a place of great trade; Baxay (Bassein), a good seaport in which much goods are exchanged; and Tanamayambu (Th&#225;na-M&#225;him), a town of great Moorish mosques, but of little trade. (Stanley&#8217;s Barbosa, 59&#8211;68). The only one of these ports whose identification seems doubtful is Ravel, described by Barbosa (page 67) as a pretty town of the Moors on a good river, twenty leagues south of Gandh&#225;r. This agrees with the position of R&#225;nder on the T&#225;pti, nearly opposite Surat, which appears in Al B&#237;r&#250;ni (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1030) as R&#225;hanur one of the capitals of south Gujar&#225;t and is mentioned under the name R&#225;nir, both in the <corr sic="&#193;in-i-Akb&#225;ri">&#193;in-i-Akbari</corr> (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1590) and in the Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi for the year <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1571, as a place of trade, &#8216;in ancient times a great city.&#8217; In his description of the wealth of Cambay, Barbosa is supported by the other European travellers of the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. According to Nicolo de Conti (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1420&#8211;1444), the town, including its suburbs, was twelve miles in circuit abounding in spikenard, lac, indigo, myrobalans, and silk. Athanasius Nikotin (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1468&#8211;1474) found it a manufacturing place for every sort of goods as long gowns damasks and blankets; and Varthema (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1503&#8211;1508) says it abounds in grain and very good fruits, supplying Africa Arabia and India with silk and cotton stuffs; <corr>&#8216;</corr>it is impossible to describe its excellence.&#8217; Barbosa&#8217;s account of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d is borne out by the statement in the &#193;in-i-Akbari (Gladwin, II. 63) that the whole number of the suburbs (<hi>pur&#225;s</hi>) of the city was 360, and in the Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi, that it once contained 380 suburbs each of considerable size, containing good buildings and markets filled with everything valuable and rare, so that each was almost a city.

The high road from P&#225;tan to Baroda was throughout its length of 150 miles (100 <hi>kos</hi>) lined on both sides with mango trees; the fields were bounded with hedges; and such was the abundance of mango and other fruit trees that the whole country seemed a garden. The people were well housed in dwellings with walls of brick and mortar and with tiled roofs; many of them rode in carriages drawn by oxen<corr sic=":">;</corr> the province was famous for its painters, carvers, inlayers, and other craftsmen.<note id="n221.1" n="1">Gladwin&#8217;s &#193;in-i-Akbari, II. 62&#8211;63.

Of its twenty-five districts nine were restored to the states from which the vigour of the &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d kings had wrested them; J&#225;lor and Jodhpur were transferred to R&#225;jput&#225;na; N&#225;gor to Ajm&#237;r; Mulher and Nandurb&#225;r to Kh&#225;ndesh; Bombay, Bassein, and Daman were allowed to remain under the Portuguese; and <corr sic="Danda-R&#225;j&#225;puri">Danda-R&#225;japuri</corr> (Jinjira) was made over to the Niz&#225;msh&#225;hi (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1490&#8211;1595) rulers of the Dakhan Ahmednagar. Of the remaining sixteen, Sirohi, Dungarpur, and B&#225;nsv&#225;da now in R&#225;jput&#225;na, Kachh, S&#251;nth in Rewa K&#225;ntha, and R&#225;mnagar (Dharampur) in Surat were, on the payment of tribute, allowed to continue in the hands of their Hindu rulers. The ten remaining districts were administered directly by imperial officers. But as the revenues of the district of Surat had been separately assigned to its revenue officer or <hi>mutasaddi</hi>, only nine districts with 184 sub-divisions or <hi>pargan&#225;hs</hi> were entered in the collections from the viceroy of Gujar&#225;t. These nine districts were in continental Gujar&#225;t, P&#225;tan with seventeen sub-divisions, &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d with thirty-three, Godhra with eleven, Ch&#225;mp&#225;ner with thirteen, Baroda with four, Broach with fourteen, and R&#225;jpipla (N&#225;ndod) with twelve. In the peninsula were Sorath with sixty-two and Nav&#225;nagar with seventeen sub-divisions. This lessening of area seems to have been accompanied by even more than a corresponding reduction in the state demand. Instead of &#163;5,840,050 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 5,84,00,500), the revenue recovered in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1571, two years before the province was annexed, under the arrangement introduced by the emperor Akbar, the total amount, including the receipts from Surat and the tribute of the six feudatory <pb id="pb222" n="222"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Introduction.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Condition of Gujar&#225;t</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1297&#8211;1760.</item><item>Under the Mughals, 1573&#8211;1760.</item></list> </fw>districts, is returned at &#163;1,999,113 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 1,99,91,130) or little more than one-third part of what was formerly collected.<note id="n222.1" n="1">The decrease in the Mughal collections from Gujar&#225;t compared with the revenues of the &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d kings may have been due to Akbar&#8217;s moderation. It may also have been due to a decline in prosperity. Compare Roe&#8217;s (1617) account of Toda about fifty miles south-east of Ajm&#237;r. It was the best and most populous country Roe had seen in India. The district was level with fertile soil abounding in corn cotton and cattle and the villages were so numerous and near together as hardly to exceed a <hi>kos</hi> from each other. The town was the best built Roe had seen in India tiled two-storied houses good enough for decent shopkeepers. It had been the residence of a R&#225;jput R&#225;ja before the conquests of Akbar Sh&#225;h and stood at the foot of a good and strong rock about which were many excellent works of hewn stone, well cut, with many tanks arched over with well-turned vaults and large and deep descents to them. Near it was a beautiful grove two miles long and a quarter of a mile broad all planted with mangoes tamarinds and other fruit trees, divided by shady walks and interspersed with little temples and idol altars with many fountains wells and summer houses of carved stone curiously arched so that a poor banished Englishman might have been content to dwell there. This observation may serve universally for the whole country that ruin and devastation operate everywhere. For since the property of all has become vested in the king no person takes care of anything so that in every place the spoil and devastations of war appear and nowhere is anything repaired.

 </p><p>According to the Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi this revenue of &#163;1,999,113 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 1,99,91,130) continued to be realised as late as the reign of Muhammad Sh&#225;h (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1719&#8211;1748). But within the next twelve years (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1748&#8211;1762) the whole revenue had fallen to &#163;1,235,000 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 1,23,50,000). Of &#163;1,999,113 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 1,99,91,130), the total amount levied by Akbar on the annexation of the province, &#163;520,501 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 52,05,010), or a little more than a quarter, were set apart for imperial use and royal expense; &#163;55,000 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 5,50,000) were assigned for the support of the viceroy and the personal estates of the nobles, and the remainder was settled for the pay of other officers of rank and court officials. Nearly &#163;30,000 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 3,00,000) were given away as rewards and pensions to religious orders and establishments.<note id="n222.2" n="2">Bird&#8217;s History of Gujar&#225;t. Another detailed statement of the revenue of Gujar&#225;t given in the Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi, apparently for the time when the author wrote (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760) gives: Revenue from crown lands &#163;2,107,518; tribute-paying divisions or <hi>sark&#225;rs</hi> &#163;12,700; Mah&#237; K&#225;ntha tribute &#163;178,741; <corr sic="Watrak">V&#225;trak</corr> K&#225;ntha tribute &#163;159,768; and S&#225;bar K&#225;ntha tribute &#163;121,151; in all &#163;2,579,878: adding to this &#163;20,000 for Kachh, &#163;40,000 for Dungarpur, and &#163;5000 for Sirohi, gives a grand total of &#163;2,644,878. According to a statement given by Bird in a note at page 108 of his History, the revenue of Gujar&#225;t under Jeh&#225;ngir (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1605&#8211;1627) averaged &#163;1,250,000; under Aurangz&#237;b (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1658&#8211;1707) &#163;1,519,622; and under Muhammad Sh&#225;h (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1719&#8211;1748) &#163;1,218,360. In this passage the revenue under the emperor Akbar (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1556&#8211;1605) is given at &#163;66,845. This total is taken from Gladwin&#8217;s &#193;in-i-Akbari. But at vol. II. page 73 of that work there would seem to be some miscalculation; for while the total number of <hi>d&#225;ms</hi> (&#8203;1&#8260;40&#8203;th of a rupee) is 43,68,02,301, the conversion into rupees is <abbr>Rs.</abbr> 10,96,123 instead of <abbr>Rs.</abbr> 1,09,20,057&#189;. The corresponding returns given by Mr. Thomas (Rev. of the Mog. Emp. page 52) are under Akbar, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1594, &#163;1,092,412; under Sh&#225;h Jah&#225;n, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1648, &#163;1,325,000; and under Aurangz&#237;b, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1658 &#163;2,173,220, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1663&#8211;1666 &#163;1,339,500, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1697 &#163;2,330,500, and <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1707 &#163;1,519,623. The varieties in the currency employed in different parts of the accounts cause some confusion in calculating the Gujar&#225;t revenue. Under the &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d kings the accounts were kept in <hi>t&#225;nk&#225;s</hi> or &#8203;1&#8260;100&#8203; of rupees, while under the Mughals <hi>d&#225;ms</hi> or &#8203;1&#8260;45&#8203;th of a rupee took the place of <hi>t&#225;nk&#225;s</hi>.

The survey which was entrusted to R&#225;ja Todar Mal, the revenue minister of the empire, was completed in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1575. The operations were confined to a small portion of the whole area of the province. Besides the six tributary districts which were unaffected by the measure, Godhra in the east, the western peninsula, and a large portion of the central strip of directly governed lands were excluded, so that of the 184 sub-divisions only 64 were surveyed. In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1575, of 7,261,849 acres (12,360,594 <hi>bigh&#225;s</hi>), the whole area measured, 4,920,818 acres (8,374,498 <hi>bigh&#225;s</hi>) or about two-thirds were found to be fit for cultivation, and the remainder was waste. In those parts of the directly governed districts where the land was not measured the existing method of determining the government share of the produce either by selecting a portion of the field while the crop was still standing, or by dividing the grain heap at harvest time, was continued. In surveyed districts the amount paid was determined by the area and character of the land under cultivation. Payment was made either in grain or in money, according to the instructions issued to the revenue-collectors, &#8216;that when it would not prove oppressive the value of the grain should be taken in ready money at the market price.&#8217;<note id="n223.1" n="1">&#193;in-i-Akbari (Gladwin), I. 305. The &#193;in-i-Akbari mentions four ways of calculating the state share in an unsurveyed field: (1) to measure the land with the crops standing and make an estimate; (2) to reap the crops, collect the grain in barns, and divide it according to agreement; (3) to divide the field as soon as the seed is sown; and (4) to gather the grain into heaps on the field and divide it there.</note> The chief change in the revenue management was that, instead of each year calculating the government share from the character of the crop, an uniform demand was fixed to run for a term of ten years.

 </p><p>Another important effect of this survey was to extend to cultivators in simple villages the proprietary interest in the soil formerly enjoyed only by the shareholders of joint villages. By this change the power of the military nobles to make undue exactions from the cultivators in their assigned lands was to some extent checked. It was, perhaps, also an indirect effect of this more definite settlement of the crown demand that the revenue agents of government and of the holders of assigned lands, finding that the revenues could be realised without their help, refused to allow to the heads of villages certain revenue dues which, in return for their services, they had hitherto enjoyed. Accordingly, in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1589&#8211;90, these heads of villages appealed to government and Akbar decided that in assigned districts as well as in the crown domains from the collections of government lands two-and-a-half per cent should be set apart as a perquisite for men of this class.<note id="n223.2" n="2">The men to whom this 2&#189; per cent was granted are referred to in the Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi as <hi>des&#225;is</hi>. Whatever doubt may attach to the precise meaning of the term <hi>des&#225;i</hi> it seems clear that it was as village headmen that the <hi>des&#225;is</hi> petitioned for and received this grant. These <hi>des&#225;is</hi> were the heads of villages with whom, as noticed above, the government agent for collecting the revenue dealt, and who, agreeing for the <pb/>whole village contribution, themselves carried out the details of allotment and collection from the individual cultivators. In the sharehold villages north of the Narbada, the headman who would be entitled to this 2&#189; per cent was the representative of the body of village shareholders. South of the Narbada, in villages originally colonised by officers of the state, the representatives of these officers would enjoy the 2&#189; per cent. In south Gujar&#225;t the <hi>des&#225;is</hi> or heads of villages also acted as district hereditary revenue officers; but it was not as district hereditary revenue officers, but as heads of villages, that they received from Akbar this 2&#189; per cent assignment. In north Gujar&#225;t there were <hi>des&#225;is</hi> who were only district revenue officers. These men would seem to have received no part of Akbar&#8217;s grant in 1589&#8211;90, for as late as <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1706 the emperor Aurangz&#237;b, having occasion to make inquiries into the position of the <hi>des&#225;is</hi>, found that hitherto they had been supported by cesses and illegal exactions, and ordered that a stop should be put to all such exactions, and a fixed assignment of 2&#189; per cent on the revenues of the villages under their charge should be allowed them. It does not appear whether the Surat <hi>des&#225;is</hi> succeeded in obtaining Aurangz&#237;b&#8217;s grant of 2&#189; per cent as district revenue officers in addition to Akbar&#8217;s (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1589) assignment of 2&#189; per cent as heads of villages.</note>

An inquiry was instituted, and, to satisfy the claims of landowners of this class, it was agreed that, on furnishing good security for their conduct and receiving the government mark on their contingent of cavalry, they should again be put in possession of a one-fourth share of the land of government villages. While the province was managed agreeably to these regulations, says the author of the Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi, its prosperity continued to increase.<note id="n224.1" n="1">Bird&#8217;s History of Gujar&#225;t, 409.</note>

 </p><p>Though these measures did much to check internal disorder, Gujar&#225;t, for several years after it came under Mughal control, continued disturbed by insurrections among the nobles, and so imperfectly protected from the attacks of foreign enemies that between the years <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1573 and 1609 each of its three richest cities, &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d Cambay and Surat, was in turn taken and plundered.<note id="n224.2" n="2">&#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1583) by Muzaffar Sh&#225;h the last king of Gujar&#225;t; Cambay (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1573) by Muhammad Husain Mirza; and Surat (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1609) by Malik Ambar the famous general of the king of <corr sic="&#193;hmednagar">Amednagar</corr>. In such unsettled times it is not surprising that the European travellers of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, between &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d and Cambay found native merchants marching in large weekly caravans which rested at night within a space barricaded by carts. (Kerr, IX. 127 and 201.) The English merchants, on their way from one factory to another, were accompanied by an escort, and, in spite of their guard, were on more than one occasion attacked by large bands of R&#225;jputs. (Kerr, IX. 127, 187, 201, 203.) As regards the state of the different parts of the province, Nicholas Ufflet, who went from Agra to Surat about 1610, describes the north, from Jh&#225;lor to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, as throughout the whole way a sandy and woody country, full of thievish beastly men, and savage beasts such as lions and tigers; from &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d to Cambay the road was through sands and woods much infested by thieves; from Cambay to Broach it was a woody and dangerous journey; but from Broach to Surat the country was goodly, fertile, and full of villages, abounding in wild date trees. (Kerr, VIII. 303.) Passing from the mouth of the T&#225;pti to Surat Mr. Copland (24th Dec. 1613) was delighted to see at the same time the goodliest spring and harvest he had ever seen. &#8216;Often of two adjoining fields, one was as green as a fine meadow, and the other waving yellow like gold and ready to be cut down, and all along the roads were many goodly villages.&#8217; (Kerr, IX. 119.) At that time the state of north-east Gujar&#225;t was very different. Terry, 1617 (Voyage, 404), describes the passage of nineteen days from M&#225;ndu near Dh&#225;r to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d as short journeys in <pb/>a wilderness where a way had to be cut and made even and the great space required for the Mughal&#8217;s camp rid and made plain by grubbing up trees and bushes. And between Cambay and &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d De la Valle, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1623 (Travels, <corr sic="Haklyt">Hakluyt</corr> <abbr expan="Edition">Ed.</abbr> I. 92), resolved to go with the k&#225;fila since the insecurity of the ways did not allow him to go alone. Still at that time Gujar&#225;t as a whole (see above page <ref target="n220.2">220 note 2</ref>) was an exceeding rich province, a description which twenty years later (1638) is borne out by Mandelslo (Travels, French Edition, 56): No province in India is more fertile; none yields more fruit or victuals. With the boast of the author of the Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1756) that Gujar&#225;t was the richest province in India compare Kh&#225;fi Khan&#8217;s (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1719) remark (Elliot, VII. 530): This rich province which no other province in India can equal.</note> During the rest <pb id="pb225" n="225"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Introduction.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Condition of Gujar&#225;t</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1297&#8211;1760.</item><item>Under the Mughals, 1573&#8211;1760.</item></list> </fw>of the seventeenth century, though the country was from time to time disturbed by Koli and R&#225;jput risings, and towards the end of the century suffered much from the raids of the Mar&#225;th&#225;s, the viceroys were, on the whole, able to maintain their authority, repressing the outbreaks of the disorderly classes, and enforcing the imperial claims for tribute on the more independent feudatory chiefs. Throughout the greater part of the seventeenth century the general state of the province seems to have been prosperous. Its cities were the wonder of European travellers. Surat, which only since the transfer of Gujar&#225;t to the Mughal empire had risen to hold a place among its chief centres of trade, was, in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1664, when taken by Shiv&#225;ji, rich enough to supply him with plunder in treasure and precious stones worth a million sterling<note id="n225.1" n="1">Orme&#8217;s Historical Fragments, 12.</note>; and at that time Cambay is said to have been beyond comparison greater than Surat, and &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d much richer and more populous than either.<note id="n225.2" n="2">The following are some of the notices of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d and Cambay by the European travellers of the seventeenth century: Cambay, 1598, trade so great that if he had not seen it he would not have believed it possible (C&#230;sar Frederick); 1623, indifferent large with sufficiently spacious suburbs and a great concourse of vessels (De la Valle, <corr sic="Haklyt">Hakluyt</corr> Edition, I. 66&#8211;67); 1638, beyond comparison larger than Surat (Mandelslo, 101&#8211;108); 1663&#8211;1671, twice as big as Surat (Bald&#230;us in Churchill, III. 506). &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, 1598, a very great city and populous (C&#230;sar Frederick); 1623, competently large with great suburbs, a goodly and great city, with large fair and straight but sadly dusty streets (De la Valle, <corr sic="Haklyt">Hakluyt</corr> Edition, I. 95); 1627, large and beautiful with many broad and comely streets, a rich and uniform baz&#225;r, and shops redundant with gums perfumes spices silks cottons and calicoes (Herbert&#8217;s Travels, 3rd Edition, 66); 1638, great manufactures, satin and velvet, silk and cotton (Mandelslo, 80); 1695, the greatest city in India, nothing inferior to Venice for rich silks and gold stuffs (Gemelli Careri in Churchill, IV. 188).</note>

 </p><p>From the beginning of the eighteenth century disorder increased. Unable to rely for support on the imperial court, the viceroys failed to maintain order among the leading nobles, or to enforce their tribute from the more powerful feudatories. And while the small Koli and R&#225;jput landholders, freed from the control of a strong central power, were destroying the military posts, taking possession of the state share of village lands, and levying dues from their more peaceful neighbours, the burden of the Mar&#225;tha tribute was year by year growing heavier. During the last ten years of Musalm&#225;n rule so entirely did the viceroy&#8217;s authority forsake him, that, according to the author of the Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi, when the great landholders refused to pay their tribute, the viceroy had no power to enforce payment. And so faithless had the great landowners become that the viceroy could not pass the city gate without an escort.<note id="n225.3" n="3">Bird, 411.</note>

In the Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi account of the office of <hi>s&#250;bahd&#225;r</hi> or <hi>n&#225;zim s&#251;bah</hi> the following passage occurs: When occasion arose the <hi>n&#225;zims</hi> used to take with their armies the contingents of the R&#225;n&#225;s of Udepur D&#250;ngarpur and B&#225;nsv&#225;da, which were always permanently posted outside their official residences (in &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d). This shows that these great <hi>zam&#237;nd&#225;rs</hi> had official residences at the capital, where probably their contingents were posted under <hi>wak&#237;ls</hi> or agents. It therefore seems probable that their tribute too would be paid through their representatives at the capital and that a military force was seldom sent against them. Accordingly notices of military expeditions in the tributary <hi>sark&#225;rs</hi> are rare though they were of constant occurrence in the crown districts.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Crown Zam&#237;nd&#225;rs.</note>The position of the <hi>zam&#237;nd&#225;rs</hi> of the <hi>kh&#225;lsa</hi> or crown districts was very different from that of the <hi>zam&#237;nd&#225;rs</hi> of self-governed territories. The <hi>kh&#225;lsa zam&#237;nd&#225;rs</hi> had been deprived of the greater portion of their ancestral estates which were administered by the viceregal revenue establishment. In some instances their capitals had been annexed. Even if not annexed the capital was the seat of <hi>faujd&#225;r</hi> who possessed the authority and encroached daily on the rights and privileges of the chieftain. The principal chiefs in this position were those of R&#225;jp&#237;pla and &#205;dar in Gujar&#225;t and the J&#225;m of Nav&#225;nagar in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a. Of the three, R&#225;jpipla had been deprived of his capital N&#225;ndod and of all the fertile districts, and was reduced to a barren sovereignty over rocks<corr>,</corr> hills and Bh&#237;ls at R&#225;jp&#237;pla. &#205;dar had suffered similar treatment and the capital was the seat of a Muhammadan <hi>faujd&#225;r</hi>. Nav&#225;nagar, which had hitherto been a tributary <hi>sark&#225;r</hi>, was during the reign of Aurangz&#237;b made a crown district. But after Aurangz&#237;b&#8217;s death the J&#225;m returned to his capital and again resumed his tributary relations.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Smaller Zam&#237;nd&#225;rs.</note>The lesser holders, including <hi>gr&#225;si&#225;s w&#225;nt&#225;d&#225;rs</hi> and others, had suffered similar deprivation of lands and were subject to much encroachment from the government officials. Throughout the empire widespread discontent prevailed among subordinate holders of this description as well as among all the <hi>zam&#237;nd&#225;rs</hi> of the crown districts, so that the successes of Shiv&#225;ji in the Dakhan found ardent sympathisers even in Gujar&#225;t. When the <hi>zam&#237;nd&#225;rs</hi> saw that this Hindu rebel was strong enough to pillage Surat they began to hope that a day of deliverance was near. The death of Aurangz&#237;b (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1707) was the signal for these restless spirits to bestir themselves. When the Mar&#225;th&#225;s began regular inroads they were hailed as deliverers from the yoke <pb id="pb227" n="227"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Introduction.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Condition of Gujar&#225;t</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1297&#8211;1760.</item><item>Smaller Zam&#237;nd&#225;rs.</item></list> </fw>of the Mughal. The R&#225;jp&#237;pla chief afforded them shelter and a passage through his country. The encouragement to anarchy given by some of the R&#225;jput viceroys who were anxious to emancipate themselves from the central control further enabled many chieftains <hi>gir&#225;si&#225;s</hi> and others to absorb large portions of the crown domains, and even to recover their ancient capitals. Finally disaffected Muhammadan <hi>faujd&#225;rs</hi> succeeded in building up estates out of the possessions of the crown and founding the families which most of the present Muhammadan chieftains of Gujar&#225;t represent.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Mar&#225;tha Ascendancy, 1760&#8211;1802.</note>When the imperial power had been usurped by the Mar&#225;tha leaders, the chiefs who had just shaken off the more powerful Mughal yoke were by no means disposed tamely to submit to Mar&#225;tha domination. Every chief resisted the levy of tribute and <corr sic="Momin">Mom&#237;n</corr> Kh&#225;n reconquered &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. In this struggle the Mar&#225;th&#225;s laboured under the disadvantage of dissensions between the Peshwa and the G&#225;ikw&#225;r. They were also unaware of the actual extent of the old imperial domain and were ignorant of the amount of tribute formerly levied. They found that the <hi>faujd&#225;rs</hi>, who, in return for Mar&#225;tha aid in enabling them to absorb the crown <hi>pargan&#225;hs</hi>, had agreed to pay tribute, now joined the <hi>zam&#237;nd&#225;rs</hi> in resisting Mar&#225;tha demands, while with few exceptions the <hi>des&#225;is</hi> and <hi>majmud&#225;rs</hi> either openly allied themselves with the <hi>zam&#237;nd&#225;rs</hi> or were by force or fraud deprived of their records. <note place="margin">G&#225;ikw&#225;r Saved by British Alliance, 1802.</note>So serious were the obstacles to the collection of the Mar&#225;tha tribute that, had it not been for the British alliance in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1802, there seems little doubt that the G&#225;ikw&#225;r would have been unable to enforce his demands in his more distant possessions. The British alliance checked the disintegration of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s power, and the permanent settlement of the tribute early in this century enabled that chief to collect a large revenue at a comparatively trifling cost. Not only were rebels like Malh&#225;rr&#225;o and K&#225;noji suppressed, but powerful servants like Vithalr&#225;v Dev&#225;ji, who without doubt would have asserted their independence, were confirmed in their allegiance and the rich possessions they had acquired became part of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s dominions.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Power of Chiefs.</note>It must not be supposed that while the larger chiefs were busy absorbing whole <hi>pargan&#225;hs</hi> the lesser chiefs were more backward.

Even in the Baroda district of the thirteen Mughal posts only ten now belong to the G&#225;ikw&#225;r, two having been conquered by <hi>gir&#225;si&#225;s</hi> and one having fallen under Broach.

It was thus that the Gujar&#225;t Sult&#225;ns rendered themselves independent of Dehli. It was thus that the Sult&#225;n&#8217;s territories became divided among the nobles, whose dissensions reduced the province to Akbar&#8217;s authority. It was thus that the chiefs and local governors, conniving at Mar&#225;tha inroads, subverted Mughal rule. Finally it was thus that the G&#225;ikw&#225;r lost his hold of his possessions and was rescued from ruin solely by the power of the British.

Of Waj&#237;h-ul-Mulk&#8217;s rise to power at the Dehli court the following story is told. Before he sat on the throne of Dehli, F&#237;r&#250;z Tughlak, when hunting in the Punj&#225;b, lost his way and came to a village near Th&#225;nesar, held by chieftains of the T&#225;nk tribe. He was hospitably entertained by two brothers of the chief&#8217;s family named S&#225;h&#225;ran and S&#225;dhu, and became enamoured of their beautiful sister. When his hosts learned who the stranger was, they gave him their sister in marriage and followed his fortunes. Afterwards F&#237;r&#250;z persuading them to embrace Isl&#225;m, conferred on Sah&#225;ran the title of <corr sic="Wajih-ul-Mulk">Waj&#237;h-ul-Mulk</corr>, and on S&#225;dhu the title of Shamsh&#237;r Kh&#225;n.

The period may conveniently be divided into two parts. The first, lasting for a little more than a century and a quarter, when, under strong rulers, Gujar&#225;t rose to consequence among the kingdoms of Western India; the second, from <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1536 to <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1573, an evil time when the sovereigns were minors and the wealth and supremacy of Gujar&#225;t were wasted by the rivalry of its nobles.

 </p><p>The date on which Zafar Kh&#225;n openly threw off his allegiance to Dehli is doubtful. Farishtah says he had the Friday prayer or <hi>khutbah</hi> repeated in his name after his successful campaign against Jh&#225;l&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a and Delv&#225;&#7693;a in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1396.

On his way to P&#225;tan the king sickened and died. His body was brought back to P&#225;tan, and the expedition against Dehli came to nothing. It seems probable that this is a courtly version of the tale; the fact being that in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1403 T&#225;t&#225;r Kh&#225;n imprisoned his father at As&#225;wal, and assumed the title of Muhammad Sh&#225;h, and that T&#225;t&#225;r Kh&#225;n&#8217;s death was caused by poison administered in the interest, if not at the suggestion, of his father Zafar Kh&#225;n.<note id="n234.1" n="1">Compare Farishtah, II. 355&#8211;356.

Thus the emperor Akbar&#8217;s after-death title is &#193;rsh &#193;shi&#225;ni, The Holder of the Heavenly Throne; the emperor Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r&#8217;s is Jannat Mak&#225;ni, The Dweller in Heaven; the emperor Sh&#225;h Jeh&#225;n&#8217;s is Firdaus Mak&#225;ni, He Whose Home is Paradise; and the emperor Aurangz&#237;b&#8217;s is Khuld Mak&#225;ni, The Occupier of the Eternal Residence. Similarly the after-death title of Muzaffar Sh&#225;h, T&#225;t&#225;r Kh&#225;n&#8217;s father, is Kh&#251;d&#225;ig&#225;n-i-Kabir, The Great Lord.</note>

 </p><p>Sult&#225;n &#193;hmed is still a name of power among Gujar&#225;t Musalm&#225;ns. He is not more honoured for his bravery, skill, and success as a war leader than for his piety and his justice. His piety showed itself in his respect for three great religious teachers Sheikh Rukn-ud-d&#237;n the representative of Sheikh Mo&#237;n-ud-d&#237;n the great Khw&#225;jah of Ajm&#237;r, Sheikh &#193;hmed Khattu who is buried at Sarkhej five miles west of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, and the Bukh&#225;ran Sheikh Burh&#225;n-ud-d&#237;n known as Kutbi &#193;lam the father of the more famous Sh&#225;h &#193;lam. Of &#193;hmed&#8217;s justice two instances are recorded. Sitting in the window of his palace watching the S&#225;barmati in flood &#193;hmed saw a large earthen jar float by. The jar was opened and the body of a murdered man was found wrapped in a blanket. The potters were called and one said the jar was his and had been sold to the headman of a neighbouring village. On inquiry the headman was proved to have murdered a grain merchant and was hanged. The second case was the murder of a poor man by &#193;hmed&#8217;s son-in-law. The K&#225;zi found the relations of the deceased willing to accept a blood fine and when the fine was paid released the prince. &#193;hmed hearing of his son-in-law&#8217;s release said in the case of the rich fine is no punishment and ordered his son-in-law to be hanged.<note id="n240.1" n="1">Mir&#259;t-i-Sikandari Persian Text, 45, 46.</note>

Muzaffar Kh&#225;n, who is said to have incited the M&#225;lwa Sult&#225;n to invade Gujar&#225;t, was captured and beheaded, and his head was hung up at the gate of Kapadvanj. On his return from Kapadvanj Kutb-ud-d&#237;n built the magnificent Hauzi Kutb or K&#225;nkariya Tank about a mile to the south of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. According to the Mir&#259;t-i-Sikandari (Persian Text, 50&#8211;57) this war between M&#225;lwa and Gujar&#225;t was controlled by the spiritual power of certain holy teachers. The war was brought on by the prayers of Sheikh Kam&#225;l M&#225;lwi, whose shrine is in &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d behind Khud&#225;wand Kh&#225;n&#8217;s mosque near <corr sic="Sh&#225;h-i-Alam&#8217;s">Sh&#225;h-i-&#193;lam&#8217;s</corr> tomb, who favoured M&#225;lwa.

At last Kam&#225;l produced a writing said to be from heaven giving the victory to M&#225;lwa. The young Sh&#225;h &#193;lam tore this charter to shreds, and, as no evil befel him, Kam&#225;l saw that his spiritual power paled before Sh&#225;h &#193;lam and fell back dead. Sh&#225;h &#193;lam against his will accompanied Kutb-ud-d&#237;n some marches on his advance to Kapadvanj. Before leaving the army Sh&#225;h &#193;lam blessed a mean camp elephant and ordered him to destroy the famous M&#225;lwa champion elephant known as the Butcher. He also, against his wish for he knew the future, at the Sult&#225;n&#8217;s request bound his own sword round Kutb-ud-d&#237;n&#8217;s waist. In the battle the commissariat elephant ripped the Butcher and some years later Kutb-ud-d&#237;n by accident gashed his knee with the saint&#8217;s sword and died.

 </p><p>The close connection of Fateh Kh&#225;n with the saintly Sh&#225;h &#193;lam is a favourite topic with Gujar&#225;t historians. According to the Mir&#259;t-i-Sikandari (Persian Text, 66&#8211;70) of his two daughters J&#225;m J&#250;na intended B&#237;bi Mughli the more beautiful for the Saint and B&#237;bi Mirghi the less comely for the Sult&#225;n. By bribing the J&#225;m&#8217;s envoys the king secured the prettier sister. The enraged Saint was consoled by his father who said: My son, to you will come both the cow and the calf. After Muhammad II.&#8217;s death, fear of Kutb-ud-d&#237;n&#8217;s designs against the young Fateh Kh&#225;n forced B&#237;bi Mughli to seek safety with her sister, and on her sister&#8217;s death she married the Saint. Kutb-ud-d&#237;n made several attempts to seize Fateh Kh&#225;n. But by the power of the Saint when Kutb-ud-d&#237;n attempted to seize him, Fateh Kh&#225;n in body as well as in dress became a girl. According to one account Kutb-ud-d&#237;n met his death in an attempt to carry off Fateh Kh&#225;n. As he rode into the Saint&#8217;s quarter Death in the form of a mad camel met the king. The king struck at the phantom, and his sword cleaving the air gashed his knee. This was the Saint&#8217;s sword, which against his will, for he knew it would be the death of the king, Kutb-ud-d&#237;n forced Sh&#225;h &#193;lam to bind round him before the battle of Kapadvanj.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Defeats a Conspiracy, 1459.</note>The death of his uncle, the late Sult&#225;n D&#225;&#250;d, who had become a religious devotee, relieved Fateh Kh&#225;n of one source of danger. Shortly after certain of the nobles including Seiful Mulk, Kab&#237;r-ud-d&#237;n Sult&#225;ni surnamed Akd-ul-Mulk, Burh&#225;n-ul-Mulk and His&#225;m-ul-Mulk represented to the Sult&#225;n that the minister Sha&#226;b&#225;n Im&#225;d-ul-Mulk contemplated treason and wished to set his son on the throne. Having seized and imprisoned the minister in the Bhadra citadel and set five hundred of their trusted retainers as guards over him, the rebels retired to their homes. At nightfall Abdull&#225;h, the chief of the elephant stables, going to the young Sult&#225;n represented to him that the nobles who had imprisoned Im&#225;d-ul-Mulk were the real traitors and had determined to place Hab&#237;b Kh&#225;n, an uncle of the Sult&#225;n&#8217;s, on the throne. The Sult&#225;n consulting his mother and some of his faithful friends ordered Abdull&#225;h at daybreak to equip all his elephants in full armour and draw them up in the square before the Bhadra. He then seated himself on the throne and in a voice of feigned anger ordered one of the courtiers to bring out Sha&#226;b&#225;n Im&#225;d-ul-Mulk, that he might wreak his vengeance <pb id="pb244" n="244"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter II.</item><item>&#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d Kings, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1403&#8211;1573.</item><item><hi rend="bold">Mahm&#250;d I.

Some of the nobles&#8217; retainers made their submission to the Sult&#225;n, others fled and hid themselves. In the morning, hearing what had happened, the refractory nobles marched against the Sult&#225;n. Many advised the Sult&#225;n to cross the S&#225;barmati by the postern gate and retire from the city, and, after collecting an army, to march against the nobles. Giving no ear to these counsels the young Sult&#225;n ordered Abdull&#225;h to charge the advancing nobles with his six hundred elephants. The charge dispersed the malcontents who fled and either hid themselves in the city or betook themselves to the country. Some were killed, some were trampled by the Sult&#225;n&#8217;s orders under the elephants&#8217; feet, and one was pardoned.<note id="n244.1" n="1">Persian Text, Mir&#259;t-i-Sikandari, 75&#8211;76.</note> His religious ardour, his love of justice, his bravery, and his wise measures entitle Mahm&#250;d to the highest place among the Gujar&#225;t kings.

Some of them carry maces, and many of them coats-of-mail, and others tunics quilted with cotton. The horses have housings and steel headpieces, and so they fight very well and are light in their movements. The Moorish horsemen are white and of many countries, Turks and Mamelukes, military slaves from Georgia Circassia and Mingrelia, Arabs Persians Khor&#225;s&#225;nis Turkomans, men from the great kingdom of Dehli, and others born in the country itself. Their pay is good, and they receive it regularly. They are well dressed with very rich stuffs of gold silk cotton and goat&#8217;s wool, and all wear caps on their heads, and their clothes long, such as morisco shirts and drawers, and leggings to the knee of good thick leather worked with gold knots and embroidery, and their swords richly ornamented with gold and silver are borne in their girdles or in the hands of their pages. Their women are very white and pretty: also very richly decked out. They live well and spend much money.

Mahm&#250;d was buried at Sarkhej,<note id="n248.4" n="4">Mahm&#250;d Begada greatly impressed travellers, whose strange tales of him made the king well-known in Europe. Varthema (1503&#8211;1508) thus describes his manner of living: &#8216;The king has constantly 20,000 horsemen. In the morning when he rises there come to his palace 50 elephants, on each of which a man sits astride, and the said elephants do reverence to the king, and, except this, they have nothing else to do. When the <pb/>king eats, fifty or sixty kinds of instruments, drums trumpets flageolets and fifes play, and the elephants again do him reverence. As for the king himself, his mustachios under his nose are so long that he ties them over his head as a woman would tie her tresses, and he has a white beard that reaches to his girdle. As to his food, every day he eats poison (Hudibras&#8217; Prince whose &#8216;daily food was asp and basilisk and toad&#8217;), not that he fills his stomach with it, but he eats a certain quantity, so that when he wishes to destroy any great person he makes him come before him stripped and naked, and then eats certain fruits which are called <hi>chofole</hi> (<hi>j&#225;iphal</hi>, nutmeg), like a muscatel nut. He also eats certain leaves called <hi>tamboli</hi> (<hi>p&#225;n</hi> or betel leaf; like the leaves of a sour orange, and with these he eats lime of oyster shells. When he has chewed this well he spurts it out on the person he wishes to kill, and so in the space of half an hour the victim falls to the ground dead. The Sult&#225;n has also three or four thousand women, and every night that he sleeps with one, she is found dead in the morning.&#8217; Barbosa (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1511) goes further (Stanley&#8217;s Trans. 57), saying that so soaked was the king with poison that if a fly settled on his hand it swelled and immediately fell dead. This was the result of his early training. For, on Varthema&#8217;s companion asking how it was that the king could eat poison in this manner, certain merchants, who were older than the Sult&#225;n, answered that his father had fed him upon poison from his childhood. (Badger&#8217;s Varthema, 110.) Of the origin of Mahm&#250;d&#8217;s surname Begada two explanations are given: (1) &#8216;From his mustachios being large and twisted like a bullock&#8217;s horn, such a bullock being called Begado; (2) that the word comes from the Gujar&#225;ti <hi>be</hi>, two, and <hi>gad</hi>, a fort, the people giving him this title in honour of his capture of <corr sic="J&#250;n&#225;ga&#7693;h">Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h</corr> (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1472) and Ch&#225;mp&#225;ner (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1484).&#8217; (Bird&#8217;s History of Gujar&#225;t, 202; Mir&#259;t-i-Ahmedi Persian Text, 74.) Varthema&#8217;s account of the poison-eating is probably an exaggeration of the Sult&#225;n&#8217;s habit of opium-eating to which from his infancy he was addicted. The Mir&#259;t-i-Sikandari (Persian Text, 751) speaks of the great physical power of Mahm&#250;d and of his wonderful appetite. Mahm&#250;d&#8217;s daily food weighed forty <hi>sers</hi> the ser being 15 <hi>bahlulis</hi> a little over half a pound. He used to eat about three pounds (5 <hi>sers</hi>) of parched gram to dessert. For breakfast, after his morning prayer, Mahm&#250;d used to consume a cupfull of pure Makkah honey with a second cupfull of clarified butter and fifty small plantains called <hi>sohan kelas</hi>. At night they set by his bed two plates of <hi>samb&#250;s&#225;s</hi> or minced mutton sausages. In the morning Mahm&#250;d seeing the empty plates used to give thanks: &#8216;Oh Allah,&#8217; he said, &#8216;hadst thou not given this unworthy slave rule over Gujar&#225;t, who could have filled his stomach.&#8217; His virile powers were as unusual as his appetite. The only woman who could bear his embraces unharmed was a powerful Abyssinian girl who was his great favourite. Of the wealth and weapons kept in store the Mir&#259;t-i-Sikandari gives the following details regarding the great expedition against <corr sic="J&#250;n&#225;ga&#7693;h">Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h</corr> (Persian Text, 94): The Sult&#225;n ordered the treasurer to send with the army gold coins worth five <hi>krors</hi>, 1700 Egyptian Allemand Moorish and Khur&#225;s&#225;ni swords with gold handles weighing 2&#189; to 3 pounds (4&#8211;5 <hi>sers</hi>), 1700 daggers and poignards with gold handles weighing 1 to 1&#189; pounds (2&#8211;3 <hi>sers</hi>), and 2000 Arab and Turki horses with gold-embroidered housings.

As the Kazil-b&#225;shes were known to be Sh&#237;ahs the Sult&#225;n, who was a staunch Sunni, prayed that he might not be forced to see a Sh&#237;ah&#8217;s face during his last days. His prayer was heard. He died before the Persian embassy entered the city.<note id="n249.1" n="1">Ferishtah, II. 404. The Mir&#259;t-i-Sikandari (Persian Text, 148, 149) calls the Persian ambassador <corr sic="&#205;br&#225;h&#237;m">Ibr&#225;h&#237;m</corr> Kh&#225;n.</note> During the last days of Sult&#225;n Mahm&#250;d, Sayad Muhammad of Jaunpur, who claimed to be the Mahdi or Messiah, came from Jaunpur and lodged in T&#225;jkh&#225;n S&#225;l&#225;r&#8217;s mosque near the Jam&#225;lpur gate of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d.

In life they vied with one another in generous acts; and after death, according to the Persian poet Urfi, they left their traces in the characters and carvings of stone walls and marble piles. First among these nobles the Mir&#259;t-i-Sikandari (Persian Text, 132, 142) mentions D&#225;war-ul-Mulk, whose god-fearing administration made his estates so prosperous that they were coveted by princes of the blood. As Th&#225;nad&#225;r of Amron in north K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a, he spread the light of Isl&#225;m from Morvi to Bh&#250;j, and after his death his fame as a spirit-ruling guardian drew hosts of sick and possessed to his shrine near Morvi. The second was Malik Ay&#225;z, governor of Diu, who built the strong fortress afterwards reconstructed by the Portuguese. He also built a tower on an under-water rock, and from the tower drew a massive iron chain across the mouth of the harbour. A substantial bridge over the creek, that runs through the island of Diu, was afterwards destroyed by the Portuguese. The third was Khud&#225;wand Kh&#225;n &#256;l&#237;m, the founder of &#256;l&#237;mpura a suburb to the south of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, adorned with a mosque of sandstone and marble. He introduced the cultivation of melons figs and sugarcane into Gujar&#225;t from Bij&#225;pur. The fourth was Im&#225;d-ul-Mulk &#256;sas who founded &#205;sanpur, a suburb between Sh&#225;h <corr sic="Alam&#8217;s">&#193;lam&#8217;s</corr> suburb of Isl&#225;mpur and Batwa, and planted along the road groves of <hi>khirnis</hi> and mangoes. The fifth was T&#225;jkh&#225;n S&#225;l&#225;r, so loved of his peers that after his death none of them would accept his title. The sixth was Malik S&#225;rang Kiw&#225;m-ul-Mulk, a R&#225;jput by birth, the founder of the suburb of S&#225;rangpur and its mosque to the east of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. The seventh and eighth were the Khur&#225;s&#225;ni brothers A&#226;zam and Mo&#226;zzam, who built a cistern, a mosque, and a tomb between &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d and Sarkhej.

 </p><p>Besides Khal&#237;l Kh&#225;n, who succeeded him, Mahm&#250;d had three sons: Muhammad K&#225;la, &#193;p&#225; Kh&#225;n, and &#193;hmed Kh&#225;n. K&#225;la, son of R&#225;ni R&#250;p Manjhri died during his father&#8217;s lifetime as did his mother, who was buried in M&#225;nek Chauk in &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d in the building known as the R&#225;ni&#8217;s Haz&#237;ra. The second son &#193;p&#225; Kh&#225;n was caught trespassing in a noble&#8217;s <hi>har&#237;m</hi>, and was ordered by the Sult&#225;n to be poisoned. The third son was the &#193;hmed Kh&#225;n whom Khud&#225;wand Kh&#225;n sought to raise to the throne during Sult&#225;n Mahm&#250;d&#8217;s lifetime.

For some time before his father&#8217;s death, Prince Khal&#237;l Kh&#225;n had been living at Baroda and shortly after his accession he visited that neighbourhood, and founded a town which he named Daulat&#225;b&#225;d.

This officer had turned aside to punish the R&#225;v for some disturbance he had created, but failing in his purpose, was himself defeated. On the approach of Muzaffar Sh&#225;h, &#205;dar was abandoned by the R&#225;v, who made his peace with difficulty and only by agreeing to pay a heavy tribute. Meanwhile the king marched to Godhra, and so to M&#225;lwa by way of Dohad, whose fort he caused to be repaired, and soon after went on to Dh&#225;r. <pb id="pb251" n="251"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter II.</item><item>&#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d Kings, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1403&#8211;1573.</item><item><hi rend="bold">Muzaffar II. 1513&#8211;1526.</hi></item></list> </fw>After a short stay in M&#225;lwa, thinking it mean to take advantage of the distracted condition of Mahm&#250;d of M&#225;lwa, who was at war with his nobles, Muzaffar returned to Muhammad&#225;b&#225;d (Ch&#225;mp&#225;ner). At this time R&#225;imal, nephew of the late R&#225;v Bh&#237;m of &#205;dar, expelled the R&#225;v&#8217;s son Bh&#225;rmal by the aid of his father-in-law R&#225;na S&#225;nga of Chitor, and succeeded to the chieftainship of &#205;dar. The king was displeased at the interference of the R&#225;na, and directed Niz&#225;m Kh&#225;n, the governor of Ahmednagar, to expel R&#225;imal and reinstate Bh&#225;rmal. Niz&#225;m Kh&#225;n took &#205;dar and gave it to Bh&#225;rmal. R&#225;imal betook himself to the hills where Niz&#225;m Kh&#225;n incautiously pursuing and engaging him lost many men. When the rains were over the Sult&#225;n visited &#205;dar. Shortly after, Niz&#225;m Kh&#225;n, the governor of Ahmednagar, fell sick and was called to court. He left &#205;dar in charge of Zah&#237;r-ul-Mulk at the head of a hundred horse. R&#225;imal made a sudden raid on &#205;dar and killed Zah&#237;r-ul-Mulk and twenty-seven of his men. On hearing of this reverse Sult&#225;n Muzaffar ordered Niz&#225;m Kh&#225;n to destroy B&#237;j&#225;pur.<note id="n251.1" n="1">Farishtah, II. 408.</note> <note place="margin">Disturbances in M&#225;lwa, 1517.</note>In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1517, the nobles of M&#225;lwa besought Muzaffar&#8217;s interference, alleging that the Hindu minister Med&#225;ni R&#225;i was planning to depose the M&#225;lwa Sult&#225;n, Mahm&#250;d Khilji, and usurp the throne. Muzaffar Sh&#225;h promised to come to their help, and shortly after Sult&#225;n Mahm&#250;d Khilji, escaping from the surveillance of Med&#225;ni R&#225;i, himself sought the aid of the Gujar&#225;t monarch. In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1518 Muzaffar Sh&#225;h marched by Godhra into M&#225;lwa, and on his arrival at Dh&#225;r, that town was evacuated by Med&#225;ni R&#225;i.

This conquest virtually placed M&#225;lwa in Muzaffar&#8217;s power, but he honourably restored the kingdom to Sult&#225;n Mahm&#250;d Khilji, and, withdrawing to Gujar&#225;t, proceeded to <corr sic="Muhammad&#225;bad">Muhammad&#225;b&#225;d</corr>.

But the R&#225;na, who distinguished himself by releasing the Sult&#225;n of M&#225;lwa and keeping his son in his stead as a hostage, enjoyed continued good fortune. Some time before these events a <hi>bh&#225;t</hi> or bard in the presence of Niz&#225;m Kh&#225;n, the governor of &#205;dar, boasted that the R&#225;na of <note place="margin">War with Chitor, 1519.</note>Chitor would never fail to help R&#225;na R&#225;imal of &#205;dar.

So extreme an abstainer was he that not only during his whole life did he eschew intoxicating drugs and liquor but he never again rode a favourite horse because the horse was cured by a draught of wine. He was an accomplished musician, a finished horseman, a practised swordsman, and withal so modest and humble in his dress and temper that observing once to a favourite page how simple and yet graceful his own turban was the boy laughed: &#8216;Ay, if the turbans of Mullahs and Bohoras are graceful, then is your Majesty&#8217;s.&#8217; The Sult&#225;n said &#8216;I should have been proud to have my turban likened to a Mullah&#8217;s, why compare it with the headdress of a schismatic Bohora.&#8217; Muzaffar was careful never to pain the feelings of those around him.

The Gujar&#225;t Musalm&#225;n historians give a somewhat vague application to the word P&#225;l which means a bank or step downwards to the plain. In the Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi (P&#225;hlanpur Edition, page 168) P&#225;lvar&#225;h, whose climate is proverbially bad, includes Godhra Ali Mohan and R&#225;jp&#237;pla that is the rough eastern fringe of the plain land of Gujar&#225;t from the Mahi to the Tapti.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Chooses Evil Favourites.</note>The king entered &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, and soon after captured Ch&#225;mp&#225;ner. &#193;lam Kh&#225;n now obtained the recall of Im&#225;d-ul-Mulk, who received a grant of Broach and the port of Surat. Shortly afterwards Mahm&#250;d Sh&#225;h began to show favour to men of low degree, especially to one Charji, a birdcatcher, whom he ennobled by the title of Muh&#225;fiz Kh&#225;n. Charji counselled Mahm&#250;d to put to death Sult&#225;n Al&#225;-ud-d&#237;n Lodhi and Shuj&#225;&#226;t Kh&#225;n, two of the principal nobles; and the king, without consulting his ministers, caused these men to be executed. The nobles joining together besieged Mahm&#250;d Sh&#225;h in his palace, and demanded that Muh&#225;fiz Kh&#225;n should be surrendered to them, but the king refused to give him up. The nobles then demanded an audience, and this the king granted, Muh&#225;fiz Kh&#225;n, though warned of his danger, being foolishly present. On entering the royal presence &#193;lam Kh&#225;n signalled to his followers to slay Muh&#225;fiz, and he was killed in spite of the king&#8217;s remonstrances. Mahm&#250;d then attempted to kill himself, but was prevented and placed under guard, and the chief nobles took it in turn to watch him.

He then joined Darya Kh&#225;n, whom he called from the Dakhan, and obtained help in money from Im&#225;d-ul-Mulk of Surat and from &#193;lp Kh&#225;n of Dholka.

The viceroy M&#237;rza &#194;z&#237;z Kokalt&#225;sh with other nobles marched against them, and after a hard-fought battle, in which several of the imperial nobles were slain, M&#237;rza &#194;z&#237;z Kokalt&#225;sh was victorious. Sher Kh&#225;n again took refuge in Sorath, and his son fled for safety to the &#205;dar hills, while the M&#237;rza withdrew to the Kh&#225;ndesh frontier. As the conquest of Gujar&#225;t was completed, Akbar returned to Agra.

In honour of this victory the Kh&#225;n Kh&#225;n&#225;n built, on the site of the battle, a palace and garden enclosing all with a high wall. This which he named J&#237;tpur the City of Victory was one of the chief ornaments of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. In November 1613 the English merchant Wittington writes (Kerr&#8217;s Voyages, IX. 127): A <hi>kos</hi> from Sarkhej is a pleasant house with a large garden all round on the banks of the river which Chon-Chin-Naw (Kh&#225;n Kh&#225;n&#225;n) built in honour of a great victory over the last king of Gujar&#225;t. No person inhabits the house. Two years later (1615) another English merchant Dodsworth (Kerr, IX. 203) describes the field of Victory as strongly walled all round with brick about 1&#189; miles in circuit all planted with fruit trees and delightfully watered having a costly house called by a name signifying Victory in which Kh&#225;n Kh&#225;n&#225;n for some time resided. In 1618, the emperor Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r (Memoirs Persian Text, 210&#8211;213) on his way to Sarkhej visited the Kh&#225;n-i-Kh&#225;n&#225;n&#8217;s B&#225;ghi Fateh or Garden of Victory which he had built at a cost of two <hi>l&#225;khs</hi> of rupees ornamenting the garden with buildings and surrounding it with a wall. The natives he notices call it Fateh-W&#225;di. In 1626 the English traveller Herbert (Travels, 66) writes: Two miles nearer &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d than Sirkhej are the curious gardens and palace of Kh&#225;n Kh&#225;n&#225;n where he defeated the last of the Cambay kings and in memory built a stately house and spacious gardens the view whereof worthily attracts the traveller. Mandelslo writing in 1638 is still louder in praise of Tschietb&#225;g the Garden of Victory. It is the largest and most beautiful garden in all India because of its splendid buildings and abundance of fine fruits. Its site is one of the pleasantest in the world on the border of a great tank having on the water side many pavilions and a high wall on the side of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. The lodge and the caravanserai are worthy of the prince who built them. The garden has many fruit trees oranges, citrons, pomegranates, dates, almonds, mulberries, tamarinds, mangoes, and cocoanuts so closely planted that all walking in the garden is under most pleasing shade (Mandelslo&#8217;s Travels, French Ed. 111&#8211;112). When (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1750) the Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi was written several of the buildings and the remains of the summer house were still to be seen (Bird&#8217;s History of Gujar&#225;t, 375). A few traces of the buildings known as Fateh B&#225;di or Victory Garden remains 1879).

Finding no rest in R&#225;jp&#237;pla, after fighting and losing another battle in the R&#225;jp&#237;pla hills, he fled first to P&#225;tan and then to &#205;dar, and afterwards again repaired to L&#250;mbha K&#225;thi in Khiri. In reward for these two victories, the emperor bestowed on M&#237;rza Abd&#250;r-Rah&#237;m Kh&#225;n the title of Kh&#225;n Kh&#225;n&#225;n.

The J&#225;m of Nav&#225;nagar and Am&#237;n Kh&#225;n sent their envoys to meet the viceroy, declaring that they had not sheltered Muzaffar, and that he was leading an outlaw&#8217;s life, entirely unaided by them. The viceroy agreed not to molest them, on condition that they withheld aid and shelter from Muzaffar, and himself marched against him.

Advancing to the hills, he halted his main force outside of the rough country and sent skirmishing parties to examine the hills. Muzaffar had already passed through Nav&#225;nagar and across Gujar&#225;t to D&#225;nta in the Mahi K&#225;ntha. Here he was once more defeated by the <corr sic="Par&#225;ntej">Par&#225;ntij</corr> garrison, and a third time took refuge in R&#225;jp&#237;pla. The viceroy now marched on Nav&#225;nagar to punish the J&#225;m. The J&#225;m sent in his submission, and the viceroy taking from him, by way of fine, an elephant and some valuable horses, returned to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. He next sent a detachment against Ghazni Kh&#225;n of Jh&#225;lor who had favoured Muzaffar. Ghazni Kh&#225;n submitted, and no further steps were taken against him.

On reaching Jagat it was found that Muzaffar had already left for a village owned by a R&#225;jput named Sewa W&#225;dhel. Without halting Naurang Kh&#225;n started in pursuit, nearly surprising Muzaffar, <note place="margin">Muzaffar Flies to Kachh.</note>who escaping on horseback with a few followers, crossed to Kachh. Sewa W&#225;dhel covering Muzaffar&#8217;s retreat was surprised before he could put to sea and fought gallantly with the imperial forces till he was slain. Naurang Kh&#225;n then came to Ar&#225;mra, a village belonging to Singr&#225;m W&#225;dhel, R&#225;ja of Jagat, and after frustrating a scheme devised by that chief to entrap a body of the troops on board ship under pretence of pursuing Muzaffar&#8217;s family, led his men back to <corr sic="J&#250;n&#225;ga&#7693;h">Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h</corr>.

The Kh&#225;n-i-&#193;zam agreed to these terms and the chief captured Muzaffar and handed him to the force sent to secure him. The detachment, strictly guarding the prisoner, were marching rapidly towards Morvi, when, on reaching Dhrol, about thirty miles east of J&#225;mnagar, under pretence of obeying a call of nature, Muzaffar withdrew and cut his throat with a razor, so that he died. <note place="margin">Commits Suicide, 1591&#8211;92.</note>This happened in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1591&#8211;92.

Of the old buildings of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, the emperor (Memoirs, Persian Text, 208&#8211;210) speaks of the K&#225;nkariya tank and its island garden and of the royal palaces in the Bhadar as having nearly gone to ruin within the last fifty years. He notes that his Bakhshi had repaired the K&#225;nkariya tank and that the viceroy Mukarrab Kh&#225;n had partly restored the Bhadar palaces against his arrival. The emperor was disappointed with the capital. After the accounts he had heard it seemed rather poor with its narrow streets, its shops with ignoble fronts, and its dust, though to greet the emperor as he came on elephant-back scattering gold the city and its population had put on their holiday dress. The emperor speaks (Memoirs, Persian Text page 211) of having met some of the great men of Gujar&#225;t.

Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r speaks of the historian as a man of a refined literary style well versed in all matters of Gujar&#225;t history, who six or seven years since had entered his (the imperial) service (Memoirs, 207&#8211;211).

The men who had recently been allowed to act as viceroys had shown themselves unfit to keep in order the rebellious chiefs and predatory tribes of Gujar&#225;t. For this reason the emperor&#8217;s choice fell upon &#193;zam Kh&#225;n, a man of ability, who perceived the danger of the existing state of affairs, and saw that to restore the province to order, firm, even severe, measures were required. When &#193;zam Kh&#225;n reached Sidhpur, the merchants complained bitterly of the outrages of one K&#225;nji, a Ch&#250;nv&#225;lia Koli, who had been especially daring in plundering merchandise and committing highway robberies. <note place="margin">Punishes the Kolis,</note>&#193;zam Kh&#225;n, anxious to start with a show of vigour, before proceeding to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, marched against K&#225;nji, who fled to the village of Bh&#225;dar in the Kher&#225;lu district of Kadi, sixty miles north-east of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. &#193;zam Kh&#225;n pursued him so hotly that K&#225;nji surrendered, handed over his plunder, and gave security not only that he would not again commit robberies, but that he would pay an annual tribute of &#163;1000 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 10,000). &#193;zam Kh&#225;n then built two fortified posts in the Koli country, naming one &#193;zam&#225;b&#225;d after himself, and the other Khal&#237;l&#225;b&#225;d after his son.

He further ordered the J&#225;m to dismiss to their own countries all refugees from other parts of Gujar&#225;t. The J&#225;m being unable to cope with &#193;zam Kh&#225;n, acceded to these terms; and &#193;zam Kh&#225;n, receiving the arrears of tribute, returned to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. As &#193;zam Kh&#225;n&#8217;s stern and somewhat rough rule made him unpopular, Sayad J&#225;l&#225;l Bukh&#225;ri whose estates were being deserted from fear of him brought the matter to the emperor&#8217;s notice.

And as it was feared that in anger at being re-called &#193;zam Kh&#225;n might oppress some of those who had complained against him, this order was written by the emperor with his own hand. Thanks to &#193;zam Kh&#225;n&#8217;s firm rule, the new viceroy found the province in good order, and was able to devote his attention to financial reforms, among them the introduction of the share, <hi>bh&#225;gvat&#225;i</hi>, system of levying land revenue in kind. When M&#237;rza &#205;sa Tarkh&#225;n was raised to be viceroy of Gujar&#225;t, he appointed his son In&#225;yatull&#225;h to be governor of <corr sic="J&#250;n&#225;ga&#7693;h">Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h</corr>, and Muiz-zul-Mulk to fill the post of minister. During the viceroyalty of M&#237;rza &#205;sa Sayad Jal&#225;l Bukh&#225;ri a descendant of Saint Sh&#225;hi &#193;lam was appointed to the high post of Sadr-us-Sud&#250;r or chief law officer for the whole of India. This was a time of prosperity especially in Surat, whose port dues which were settled on the P&#225;dsh&#225;h Begam had risen from two and a half to five l&#225;khs. M&#237;rza &#205;sa Tarkh&#225;n&#8217;s term of power was brief. In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1644 the emperor appointed prince Muhammad Aurangz&#237;b to the charge of Gujar&#225;t, Muiz-zul-Mulk being ordered by the emperor to continue to act as his minister. An event of interest in the next year (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1645) is the capture of seventy-three elephants in the forests of Dohad and Ch&#225;mp&#225;ner.<note id="n279.2" n="2">The traveller Mandelslo, who was in &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d in 1638, says: No prince in Europe has so fine a court as the governor of Gujar&#225;t. Of none are the public appearances so magnificent. He never goes out without a great number of gentlemen and guards on foot and horse. Before him march many elephants with housings of brocade and velvet, standards, drums, trumpets, and cymbals. In his palace he is served like a king and suffers no one to appear before him unless he has asked an audience. (Travels, French <pb/>Edition, 151.) Of the general system of government be says: The viceroy is absolute. It is true he summons leading lords of the country to deliberate on judgments and important matters. But they are called to ascertain their views not to adopt them. On the one hand the king often changes his governors that they may not grow overpowerful. On the other hand the governors knowing they may be recalled at any time take immense sums from the rich merchants especially from the merchants of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d against whom false charges are brought with the view of forcing them to pay. As the governor is both civil and criminal judge if the merchants did not temper his greed they would be ruined beyond remedy. (Ditto, 150.) The frequent changes of viceroys in Gujar&#225;t is explained by Terry, 1615&#8211;17 (Voyage to East Indies, 364): To prevent them from becoming popular the king usually removes his viceroys after one year sending them to a new government remote from the old one. Terry adds a curious note: When the king sends any one to a place of government they never cut their hair till they return into his presence as if they desired not to appear beautiful except in the king&#8217;s sight. As soon as he sees them the king bids them cut their hair (Ditto, 365). It does not seem to have been cheating to keep up fewer horse than the number named. Terry (Voyage to East Indies, 391) says: He who hath the pay of five or six thousand must always have one thousand or more in readiness according to the king&#8217;s need of them, and so in proportion all the rest.</note>

At the same time the governorship of Surat and Cambay was given to &#193;li Akbar of Ispah&#225;n.

 </p><p>At this time (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1679) the emperor was doing his utmost to crush both the R&#225;na of Udepur and the R&#225;tho&#7693;s of M&#225;rw&#225;r. While the emperor was at Chitor, Bh&#237;msing the R&#225;na&#8217;s youngest son raided into Gujar&#225;t plundering Vadnagar Visalnagar and other towns and villages. <note place="margin">Revolt of &#205;dar, 1679.</note>The chief of &#205;dar, thinking the opportunity favourable for regaining his independence, expelled the Muhammadan garrison from &#205;dar and established himself in his capital.

His body was found by a woodcutter who brought the head to Bahlol Kh&#225;n. The head was recognized by the chief&#8217;s widow, who from that day put on mourning. Muhammad Bahlol Kh&#225;n was much praised, and was appointed to the charge of &#205;dar, and at the same time the minister Muhammad Shar&#237;f was succeeded by Abd&#250;l Lat&#237;f.<note id="n286.1" n="1">The Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi (Persian Text, 311) adds that Bahlol&#8217;s following of <hi>Kasb&#225;tis</hi> was so poorly equipped that he had to mount many of them, for whom he could not find horses, on bullocks. The sense of security in the mind of the &#205;dar chief bred by contempt at the sight of this motley crowd was the chief cause of Bahlol&#8217;s success.</note>

On hearing of the riot the emperor ordered the city to be put under martial law. The more politic viceroy contented himself by inviting Sheikh Abu Bakr and others to a banquet. After dinner he gave a piece of a poisoned watermelon to Abu Bakr, who died and the riot with him. In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1683 Muhammad Am&#237;n the viceroy died. According to the Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi, Muhammad Am&#237;n was one of the best of Gujar&#225;t governors.

In the following year on the death of Sard&#225;r Kh&#225;n at Thatha in Sindh, where he had gone as viceroy, he was, in the first instance, succeeded in the government of Sorath by Sayad Muhammad Kh&#225;n.

An imperial order was also issued directing the levy on merchandise to be taken at the place and time of sale instead of the time and place of purchase. As this change caused loss to the revenue the old system was again adopted. In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1690 the minister Am&#225;nat Kh&#225;n, with the title of &#205;tim&#225;d Kh&#225;n, was made military governor of Surat, and Sayad Muhs&#237;n was chosen minister in his place. To prevent the peons of great officials extorting fees and dues officials were forbidden to entertain peons without payment.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Revolt of Mati&#225;s and Momn&#225;s, 1691.</note>In the following year (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1691) an attempt on the part of the emperor to suppress a body of Musalm&#225;n sectarians led to a somewhat serious insurrection. Sayad Sh&#225;hji was the religious preceptor of the Mati&#225;s of Kh&#225;ndesh and the Momn&#225;s of Gujar&#225;t, two classes of converted Hindus closely allied to the Khoj&#225;s of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a, all of them being followers of Sayad Im&#225;m-ud-d&#237;n an Ism&#225;&#238;li&#225;h missionary who came to Gujar&#225;t during the reign of Mahm&#250;d Begada (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1459&#8211;1513). Hearing that his followers paid obeisance to their veiled spiritual guide by kissing his toe, the emperor ordered the guide to be sent to court to be examined before the religious doctors. Afraid of the result of this examination, the Sayad committed suicide and was buried at Karamtah nine miles south of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. The loss of their leader so enraged his followers that, collecting from all sides, they marched against Broach, seized the fort, and slew the governor. The insurgents held the fort of Broach against the governor of Baroda who was sent to punish them, and for a time successfully resisted the efforts of his successor Nazar &#193;li Kh&#225;n. At last, at an unguarded spot, some of the besiegers stole over the city wall and opening the gates admitted their companions. The Momn&#225;s were defeated and almost all slain as they sought death either by the sword or by drowning to merit their saint&#8217;s favour in the next world.

Shuj&#225;&#226;t Kh&#225;n was one of the ablest of Gujar&#225;t viceroys. He gave so much of his attention to the management of Jodhpur, that he used to spend about six months of every year in M&#225;rw&#225;r. He beautified &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d by building the college and mosque still known by his name near the L&#225;l Gate. In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1642 two hundred cart-loads of marble were received from the ancient buildings at P&#225;tan and the deputy governor Safdar Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi wrote that if a thousand cart-loads more were required they could be supplied from the same source. At this time the emperor ordered that Sheikh Akram-ud-d&#237;n, the local tax-collector, should levy the head tax from the Hindus of P&#225;lanpur and Jh&#225;lor. The viceroy deputed Muhammad Muj&#225;hid, son of Kam&#225;l Kh&#225;n Jh&#225;lori, governor of P&#225;lanpur to help in collecting. <note place="margin">Disturbances in M&#225;rw&#225;r.</note>As Durg&#225;d&#225;s <corr sic="R&#225;thod">R&#225;tho&#7693;</corr> was again stirring tumults and sedition in M&#225;rw&#225;r, the viceroy went to Jodhpur, and by confirming their estates to the chief vassals and landholders and guaranteeing other public measures on condition of service, persuaded them to abandon their alliance with Durg&#225;d&#225;s against whom he sent his deputy K&#225;zim Beg, who expelled him from M&#225;rw&#225;r.

In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1693, at the request of Sher Afghan Kh&#225;n, governor of Sorath, the walls of the fort of Jagat were restored. In this year the viceroy went to Jh&#225;l&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a to exact tribute. On his return to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d Safdar Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi, governor of P&#225;tan, wrote to the viceroy, and at his request the forts of Kambhoi and S&#225;mprah were repaired. The viceroy now went to Jodhp&#250;r and from that returned to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. A circumstance in connection with a sum of <abbr>Rs.</abbr> 7000 spent on the repairs of forts illustrates the close imperial supervision of provincial accounts. The item having come to imperial notice from the provincial disbursement sheets was disallowed as unfair and ordered to be refunded under the rule that such charges were to be met out of their incomes by the local governors and military deputy governors. Imperial officers were also from time to time deputed to collect from the books of the <hi>des&#225;i&#8217;s</hi> statements of provincial disbursements and receipts for periods of ten years that they might render an independent check. In this year the emperor hearing that Aj&#237;tsingh and Durg&#225;d&#225;s were again contemplating rebellion ordered the viceroy to Jodhpur. Muhammad Mub&#225;riz B&#225;bi was at the same time appointed deputy governor of Vadnagar, and an order was issued that the revenue of P&#225;tan should be paid to Shuj&#225;&#226;t Kh&#225;n instead of as formerly into the imperial treasury. In this year also Safdar Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi, governor of P&#225;tan, was succeeded by Mub&#225;riz Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi.

The viceroy ordered Muhammad Beg, governor of Sorath, to march against them. At this time Shuj&#225;&#226;t Kh&#225;n despatched Nazar &#193;li Kh&#225;n with a large force to join the imperial camp which was then at Panh&#225;la in Kolh&#225;pur. Shuj&#225;&#226;t Kh&#225;n, who had so long and ably filled the office of viceroy in a most critical time, died in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1703. In his place prince Muhammad A&#226;zam Sh&#225;h, who was then at Dh&#225;r in M&#225;lwa, was appointed thirty-ninth viceroy of Gujar&#225;t, as well as governor of Ajm&#237;r and Jodhpur; and until his arrival the minister Khw&#225;j&#225;h Abdul Ham&#237;d Kh&#225;n was ordered to administer the province. Owing to the recall of the late governor&#8217;s troops from many of the posts disorders broke out in the P&#225;tan districts and the Kolis plundered the country and made the roads impassable.

He was overtaking Durg&#225;d&#225;s when Durg&#225;d&#225;s&#8217; grandson praying his grandfather to make good his escape, stayed behind with a band of followers, charged the pursuers, and after a gallant combat, he and his R&#225;jputs were slain.

Emerald rings are to this day worn by youths of the B&#225;bi families of North Gujar&#225;t in memory of the emerald earrings which adorned the young R&#225;jput and were afterwards worn by Sal&#225;bat as trophies of this fight. Meanwhile Durg&#225;d&#225;s had reached Unj&#225;h-Un&#225;wa, forty miles east of P&#225;tan, and from Unj&#225;h made his way to P&#225;tan. From P&#225;tan, taking his family with him, he retired to Thar&#225;d, and from that to M&#225;rw&#225;r, where he was afterwards joined by Aj&#237;tsingh of M&#225;rw&#225;r, whom the emperor opposed on the ground of illegitimacy. The imperial troops followed and took possession of P&#225;tan, putting to death the head of the city police.

 </p><p>In his old age the emperor Aurangz&#237;b became more and more strict in religious matters. In 1702 an imperial order forbad the making of almanacs as contrary to the Muhammadan law. Hindus were also forbidden to keep Muhammadan servants.

The viceroy despatched a body of troops to guard Surat against their incursions. Disputes between the government and the Portuguese were also injuring the trade of the province. In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1701 the viceroy received an order from Court directing him to destroy the temple of Somn&#225;th beyond possibility of repair. The despatch adds that a similar order had been issued at the beginning of Aurangz&#237;b&#8217;s reign. In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1703, at the request of the merchants of Gujar&#225;t, with the view of inducing the Portuguese to let ships from Surat pass unmolested and release some Musalm&#225;ns who had been imprisoned on their way back from Makkah, orders were issued that certain confiscated Portuguese merchandise should be restored to its owners. An imperial order was also received to encourage the art of brocade weaving in &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1704, Safdar Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi was raised to be governor of Bij&#225;pur, about fifty miles north-east of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. Sarand&#225;z Kh&#225;n was at the same time appointed to Sorath instead of Muhammad Beg Kh&#225;n, who was placed in charge of the lands round &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. As the Mar&#225;th&#225;s once more threatened Surat, Mustafa Kuli, governor of Broach, was sent with 1000 horse to defend the city.

 </p><p>Certain passages in Aurangz&#237;b&#8217;s letters to prince A&#226;zam when (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1703&#8211;1705) viceroy of Gujar&#225;t, show how keen and shrewd an interest the aged emperor maintained in the government of his viceroys. In Letter 19 he writes to prince A&#226;zam: To take the government of Sorath <pb id="pb293" n="293"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter III.</item><item>Mughal Viceroys.</item><item>Aurangz&#237;b Emperor, 1658&#8211;1707.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Prince Muhammad A&#226;zam</hi> Thirty-ninth Viceroy, 1703&#8211;1705.</item></list> </fw>from Fateh Jang Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi and give it to your chamberlain&#8217;s brother is to break a sound glass vessel with your own hands. These B&#225;bis have been time out of mind a respected race in Gujar&#225;t and are well versed in the arts of war. There is no sense in giving the management of Sorath to anyone but to a B&#225;bi. Sorath is a place which commanders of five thousand like Hasan &#193;likh&#225;n and Safshikan Kh&#225;n have with difficulty administered. If your officers follow the principles laid down by the late Shuj&#225;&#226;t Kh&#225;n, it will be well. If they do not, the province of Gujar&#225;t is such that if order is broken in one or two places, it will not soon be restored. For the rest you are your own master. I say not, do this or do that; look that the end is good, and do that which is easiest. In another passage (Letter 37 to the same prince A&#226;zam) Aurangz&#237;b writes: You who are a well intentioned man, why do you not retaliate on oppressors? Over H&#225;jip&#250;r Aminp&#250;r and other posts where atrocities occur every day, and at Kapadvanj where the Kolis rob the highways up to the posts, you have made your chamberlain and artillery superintendent your commandant. He entrusted his powers to his carrion-eating and fraudulent relatives. Owing to his influence the oppressed cannot come to you.... You ought to give the command to one of the Gujar&#225;tis like Safdar Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi or one of the sons of Bahl&#250;l Sh&#237;rw&#225;ni who have earned reputations during the administration of the late Shuj&#225;&#226;t Kh&#225;n and who are popular with the people. Else I tell you plainly that on the Day of Justice we shall be caught for neglecting to punish the oppressions of our servants.

 </p><p><note place="margin">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s enter Gujar&#225;t.</note>About this time (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1705) the Mar&#225;th&#225;s, who had long been hovering on the south-east frontiers of the province, bursting into south Gujar&#225;t with an army 15,000 strong, under the leadership of Dhan&#225;ji J&#225;dhav, defeated the local forces and laid the country waste. Abd&#250;l Ham&#237;d Kh&#225;n, who was then in charge of the province, ordered all governors of districts and officers in charge of posts to collect their men and advance to Surat.

Not knowing where the Mar&#225;th&#225;s were to be found, they halted on the Narbada near the B&#225;ba Pi&#225;rah ford. Here they remained for a month and a half, the leaders contenting themselves with sending out spies to search for the enemy. At last, hearing of the approach of the Mar&#225;th&#225;s, they sent to head-quarters asking for artillery and other reinforcements. In reply, Abd&#250;l Ham&#237;d Kh&#225;n, a man of hasty temper, upbraided them for their inactivity and for allowing so much time to pass without making their way to Surat. <note place="margin">Battle of Ratanp&#250;r.

Here, apparently from the jealousy of the commanders, the different chiefs pitched their camps at some distance from each other. Finding the enemy&#8217;s forces thus scattered, the Mar&#225;th&#225;s, under the command of Dhan&#225;ji J&#225;dhav, lost no time in advancing against them. First attacking the camp of Safdar Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi, they defeated his troops, killed his son, and took prisoner the chief himself. Only a few of his men, with his nephew Muhammad A&#226;zam, escaped to the camp of Nazar &#193;li Kh&#225;n. Next, the Mar&#225;th&#225;s attacked the army under Muhammad Purdil Kh&#225;n Shirw&#225;ni; and it also they defeated. Of the Musalm&#225;n army those who were not slain, drowned in the Narbada, or captured, reached Broach in miserable plight, where they were relieved by Akbar &#193;li Kh&#225;n. Nazar &#193;li Kh&#225;n burned his tents and surrendered to the Mar&#225;th&#225;s, by whom he was well treated.

Thinking he would not risk a battle, they went to the B&#225;ba Pi&#225;rah ford, and there crossed the Narbada. That very day Abd&#250;l Ham&#237;d Kh&#225;n, with Muhammad Sher and Muhammad Sal&#225;bat, sons of Safdar Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi, and others came to the spot where the Mar&#225;th&#225;s were encamped. All night long they were harassed by the Mar&#225;th&#225;s, and next morning found the enemy ready for a general attack. The Muhammadans, weary with watching, dispirited from the defeats of Safdar Kh&#225;n, and inferior in number to their assailants, were repulsed and surrounded. The two sons of Safdar Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi, and two other nobles, seeing that the day was lost, cut their way through the enemy and escaped, Abd&#250;l Ham&#237;d Kh&#225;n, Nazar &#193;li Kh&#225;n, and many others were taken prisoners. The Mar&#225;th&#225;s plundered the Muhammadan camp, declared their right to tribute, levied sums from the adjacent towns and villages and extorted heavy ransoms which in the case of Abd&#250;l Ham&#237;d Kh&#225;n was fixed at as large a sum as &#163;30,000 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 3 <hi>l&#225;khs</hi>). <note place="margin">Koli Disturbances.</note>The Kolis, seeing the disorganized state of Gujar&#225;t, began ravaging the country, and plundered Baroda for two days.

When the news of the defeat at B&#225;ba Pi&#225;rah reached Dehli, the emperor despatched prince Muhammad Bid&#225;r Bakht with a large army to drive out the invaders.

About this time the emperor, hearing that an attack had been made on the Muhammadan post at Dw&#225;rka, ordered the temple to be levelled to the ground. It seems doubtful whether this order was carried out.

Kam&#225;l Kh&#225;n Jh&#225;lori, leaving under his son F&#237;r&#250;z Kh&#225;n at P&#225;lanpur a body of men for the defence of his charge, advanced to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d to guard the city from Mar&#225;tha attack.

As soon as Aurangz&#237;b&#8217;s death was known, the Mar&#225;th&#225;s under B&#225;l&#225;ji Vishvan&#225;th burst into east Gujar&#225;t, marching by Jh&#225;bua and Godhra, where they were ineffectually opposed by the governor Mur&#225;d Baksh. From Godhra they went to and plundered the town of Mahuda in Kaira, and proposed marching on &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d by way of Na&#7693;i&#225;d. The viceroy prepared to resist them, and, enlisting special troops, camped outside of the city near the K&#225;nkariya lake. Of the warlike population on the north bank of the S&#225;barmati opposite &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d nearly eight thousand Musalm&#225;n horse and three thousand foot together with four thousand R&#225;jp&#250;ts and Kolis in three days gathered at the K&#225;nkariya camp.

The Mar&#225;th&#225;s did much mischief, plundering as far as Batva, only four-and-a-half miles from the viceroy&#8217;s camp. The author of the Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi, whose father was an actor in these scenes, describes the panic in the capital of Gujar&#225;t which since its capture by Muzaffar in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1583 had been free from the horrors of war. Crowds of scared and terror-stricken men<corr>,</corr> women and children laden with as much of their property as they could carry were pressing from the suburbs into the city. In the city the streets were crowded with squatters. The cries of parents bereft of children, added to the din and turmoil of the soldiery, was like the horror of the Day of Resurrection. The dejected faces of the soldiers beaten in the late engagements added to the general gloom. The viceroy, thoroughly alarmed, concluded a treaty with B&#225;l&#225;ji, and on receiving a tribute of &#163;21,000 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 2,10,000) the Mar&#225;th&#225;s withdrew.

On his way the villagers of Dabh&#225;li opposed him killing one of his chief men named Alif Beg Kh&#225;n. Haidar burned the village and put all the people to death, a severity which caused such terror that throughout his rule no difficulty was experienced in realizing tribute or in keeping the roads safe. About this time, among other changes, Muhammad Bah&#225;d&#250;r, son of Sal&#225;bat Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi, was placed in charge of S&#225;dra and V&#237;rpur, with the title of Sher Kh&#225;n.

Then, returning to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, he took up his residence in the Bhadra. <note place="margin">Shows signs of Independence and is Recalled, 1722.</note>There is little doubt that at this time Haidar K&#250;li aimed at bringing all Gujar&#225;t under his rule. He seized the imperial horses which passed through &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d on their way to Dehli, and confiscated many estates and gave them to his own men. On his way to enforce tribute from the Dungarp&#250;r chiefs, he levied &#163;8000 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 80,000) from Lun&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a.

H&#225;mid Kh&#225;n, accompanied by M&#237;r Nathu, Muhammad Sal&#225;bat Rohila, and K&#225;nt&#225;ji Kadam, marched to oppose Rustam Kh&#225;n. H&#225;mid Kh&#225;n also entered into secret negotiations with P&#237;l&#225;ji G&#225;ikw&#225;r, who resolved to remain neutral and side with the conqueror. <note place="margin">Battle of Ar&#225;s.

H&#225;mid Kh&#225;n reproached K&#225;nt&#225;ji for his inactivity; but he pleaded in excuse that he was watching the mode of warfare amongst Muhammadans, and promised to attack Rustam &#193;li shortly. <note place="margin">Mar&#225;th&#225;s join H&#225;mid Kh&#225;n against Rustam &#193;li.</note>Now, as the Mar&#225;th&#225;s really desired to ruin Rustam &#193;li, who was their bitter foe, they after a few days surrounded him and cut off his supplies. Rustam &#193;li stood a blockade of eight days, and then forced his way through his enemies and went to N&#225;p&#225;d, about fourteen miles west of the V&#225;sad railway station in the Anand sub-division of the Kaira district, and thence through Kalamsar to N&#225;pa or N&#225;ba under Petl&#225;d. The Mar&#225;th&#225;s still pursuing Rustam &#193;li retired to Vasu under Petl&#225;d, ten miles east of Na&#7693;i&#225;d and about twenty-five miles south of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, where he gave battle, and by a furious charge broke the <corr sic="M&#225;ratha">Mar&#225;tha</corr> line.

When the news of the defeat and death of Rustam &#193;li reached Dehli, the emperor ordered <note place="margin">Mub&#225;riz-ul-Mulk sent against the Mar&#225;th&#225;s, 1725.</note>Mub&#225;riz-ul-Mulk to take a strong army and proceed in person to Gujar&#225;t and expel H&#225;mid Kh&#225;n and the Mar&#225;th&#225;s. Mub&#225;riz-ul-Mulk marched on Gujar&#225;t with a large army, assisted by Mah&#225;r&#225;ja Abheysingh of Jodhpur, Chatarsingh R&#225;ja of Narwar in Bundelkhand, Gandrapsingh, and the Mah&#225;r&#225;na of Udepur. On his arrival at Ajm&#237;r Mub&#225;riz-ul-Mulk was received by his private minister &#193;li Muhammad Kh&#225;n, who afterwards joined Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi in R&#225;dhanpur, and united their troops with those under Mub&#225;riz-ul-Mulk. At that time Sal&#225;bat Kh&#225;n was removed from his government, and Safdar Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi died. In obedience to the imperial order, Mub&#225;riz-ul-Mulk marched from Ajm&#237;r and came to the Gujar&#225;t frontier. On his approach H&#225;mid Kh&#225;n returned to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. He placed R&#250;psingh and Sard&#225;r Muhammad Ghorni in charge of the city and himself withdrew to Mehm&#250;d&#225;b&#225;d. Mub&#225;riz-ul-Mulk now sent Sheikh Al&#237;y&#225;r in advance with an army against &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. When Sheikh Al&#237;y&#225;r arrived before the city, Muhammad Ghorni, who was dissatisfied with H&#225;mid Kh&#225;n for bringing in the Mar&#225;th&#225;s, persuaded R&#250;psingh to fly. <note place="margin">H&#225;mid Kh&#225;n and other Mar&#225;th&#225;s Retire.</note>In the meantime Mub&#225;riz-ul-Mulk with the main body of his forces reached Sidhpur.

Mub&#225;riz-ul-Mulk marched to Mes&#225;na. About this time &#193;li Muhammad Kh&#225;n, the father of the author of the Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi, who was now with Mub&#225;riz-ul-Mulk at Mes&#225;na, advised him to conciliate the influential Muhammadan family of B&#225;bi. Under his advice, Sal&#225;bat Muhammad Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi was appointed governor of V&#237;ramg&#225;m, and Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n governor of P&#225;tan. Shortly afterwards Murlidhard&#225;s, the Gujar&#225;ti minister of H&#225;mid Kh&#225;n, deserted his master&#8217;s declining cause. When Kant&#225;ji heard that Mub&#225;riz-ul-Mulk had arrived at Peth&#225;pur, only eighteen miles from &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, he retired to Mehm&#250;d&#225;b&#225;d. <note place="margin">Mub&#225;riz-ul-Mulk enters &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, 1725.</note>Before the close of <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1725, Mub&#225;riz-ul-Mulk reached &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, where he was well received by the officials and merchants.

The Mar&#225;tha leaders, seeing that the only way to preserve their footing in the province was to espouse the cause of H&#225;mid Kh&#225;n, united their forces with his, and prepared to march on &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. Mub&#225;riz-ul-Mulk deputed his son Kh&#225;nahz&#225;d Kh&#225;n with an army to oppose them, and made several appointments, among other changes raising &#193;li Muhammad Kh&#225;n to the post of minister. <note place="margin">Defeat of the Mar&#225;th&#225;s at Sojitra and Kapadvanj, 1725.</note>Kh&#225;nahz&#225;d Kh&#225;n met the Mar&#225;th&#225;s near <corr sic="Soj&#237;tra">Sojitra</corr>, about ten miles north-west of Petl&#225;d, and defeated them, pursuing them as far as the Mahi.

Another battle was fought, and the Mar&#225;th&#225;s were again defeated and pursued as far as the hills of &#193;li-Mohan now <corr sic="Chota">Chhota</corr> Udepur in the extreme east of the province. Kh&#225;nahz&#225;d Kh&#225;n now appointed Hasan-ud-d&#237;n governor of Baroda, Broach, Jamb&#250;sar, and Makbul&#225;b&#225;d. <note place="margin">Mar&#225;tha Expedition against Vadnagar, 1725.</note>Meanwhile Ant&#225;ji Bh&#225;skar, a Mar&#225;tha noble, entering Gujar&#225;t from the side of &#205;dar, laid siege to the town of Vadnagar, which, according to the old Gujar&#225;t proverb, with Umreth in the Kaira district, are the two golden feathers of the kingdom of Gujar&#225;t. Vadnagar was inhabited by wealthy Br&#225;hmans of the N&#225;gar caste who prayed Mub&#225;riz-ul-Mulk to march to their relief; but as both his sons were in pursuit of the other Mar&#225;tha bands defeated at Kapadvanj, the viceroy had no troops to spare from the &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d garrison. The N&#225;gars accordingly, seeing no prospect of help, paid a sum of &#163;40,000 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 4 <hi>l&#225;khs</hi>) and Ant&#225;ji Bh&#225;skar retired. Kant&#225;ji and P&#237;l&#225;ji, encouraged by this raid of Ant&#225;ji&#8217;s, entered Gujar&#225;t from different quarters. K&#225;nt&#225;ji again laid siege to Vadnagar. The N&#225;gars, unable to pay the contribution demanded, leaving their property fled and K&#225;nt&#225;ji in his attempts to unearth the buried treasure burned down the town. Shortly afterwards Umreth in the Kaira district suffered a similar fate at the hands of K&#225;nt&#225;ji. In one of his raids P&#237;l&#225;ji G&#225;ikw&#225;r advancing as far as Baroda was met by Kh&#225;nahz&#225;d Kh&#225;n, the son of the viceroy. Distrusting the issue of a battle P&#237;l&#225;ji fled to Cambay, and from Cambay withdrew to Sorath. For these services the emperor raised Kh&#225;nahz&#225;d Kh&#225;n to the rank of a noble, with the title Gh&#225;lib Jang. About this time &#193;li Muhammad Kh&#225;n was dismissed from the post of minister, and in his stead first Muhammad Sayad Beg and afterwards Muhammad Sulaim&#225;n were appointed. Not long afterwards &#193;li Muhammad Kh&#225;n was again entrusted with a command and raised to be governor of Dholka.

Though he did not consent to these proposals, the viceroy so far accepted the alliance of the Peshwa as to allow the governor of Baroda to aid Ud&#225;ji Pav&#225;r against P&#237;l&#225;ji. <note place="margin">Pil&#225;ji G&#225;ikw&#225;r obtains Baroda and Dabhoi, 1727.</note>Pil&#225;ji and K&#225;nt&#225;ji outman&#339;uvred Ud&#225;ji and prevented him from effecting a junction with the governor of Baroda, who in the end was forced to abandon both that city and the stronghold of Dabhoi, while Ud&#225;ji retired to M&#225;lwa.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Mulla Muhammad &#193;li raises a Disturbance at Surat, 1729.</note>In Surat the year <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1729 was marked by a severe flood in the T&#225;pti and by a somewhat serious local disturbance. The chief cause of the disturbance was Mulla Muhammad &#193;li, a rich Musalm&#225;n trader of Surat. This man who, as &#219;mda-tut-tujj&#225;r or chief of the merchants, had already a special rank in the city, was tempted to take advantage of the disorders of the time to raise himself to the position of an independent ruler. With this object he chose as his head-quarters the island of P&#237;ram in the Gulf of Cambay, near the port of Gogha, and there spent considerable sums in strengthening the island and tempting settlers to place themselves under his protection. As P&#237;ram was not popular Mulla Muhammad fixed on the village of Athva, on the left bank of the T&#225;pti, about twelve miles from its mouth. Here he began to build a fort, but was ordered to desist by Sohr&#225;b Kh&#225;n, the governor of Surat, from which city the proposed stronghold was only three miles distant. Mulla Muhammad so far from obeying, persuaded Beglar-Beg Kh&#225;n the commander of the fort of Surat to side with him. Accordingly, next day, Beglar-Beg Kh&#225;n bombarded the governor Sohr&#225;b Kh&#225;n&#8217;s residence, proclaiming that his own brother Teghbeg Kh&#225;n was appointed governor of Surat. In the end Mulla Muhammad &#193;li induced the chief merchants of the city to pray for the removal of Sohr&#225;b who pending receipt of orders from the emperor was made to hand over his official residence in the city to Teg-Beg Kh&#225;n.

At the same time the second son, Muhammad Anwar, with the title of Safdar Kh&#225;n, was appointed to the government of R&#225;dhanpur. The viceroy now went to Na&#7693;i&#225;d, where R&#225;i Kishand&#225;s, agent of Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n, received the district of Petl&#225;d in farm. From Na&#7693;i&#225;d Mub&#225;riz-ul-Mulk went to collect tribute from Sar&#7693;&#225;rsingh, the chief of Bh&#225;darva in the Rewa K&#225;ntha about fifteen miles north of Baroda, on the banks of the Mahi, who, after some fighting, agreed to pay a sum of &#163;2000 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 20,000). On his way back to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d the viceroy levied tribute from the chief of Umeta, fifteen miles west of Baroda. As R&#225;i Kishand&#225;s failed to pay the sum agreed on for the farm of Petl&#225;d, an order was issued for his imprisonment. To save himself from the indignity he committed suicide.

Men were sent in pursuit, but in vain, and the Mar&#225;th&#225;s escaped. Meanwhile, at Surat, Mulla Muhammad &#193;li continued to build the fort at Athva. At last his accomplice, Beglar-Beg Kh&#225;n the commander of the Surat fort, began to perceive that if the Athva fort were completed the Mulla would be in a position to obstruct the trade of the port of Surat. He consequently ordered him to stop building. In spite of this the Mulla succeeded in persuading Sohr&#225;b Kh&#225;n to allow him to go on with his fort promising in return to get him confirmed as governor of Surat. Sohr&#225;b Kh&#225;n agreed, and the fort was completed, and Sohr&#225;b Kh&#225;n was duly appointed governor. As the fort was immediately below Surat the revenue of Surat was greatly diminished, and Sohr&#225;b Kh&#225;n, when it was too late, saw his mistake.

Abheysingh changed his position, and another and bloodier engagement took place, in which both sides tried to kill the opposing commander. But as both Mub&#225;riz-ul-Mulk and the Mah&#225;r&#225;ja fought disguised as common soldiers, neither party succeeded.

Accordingly the Peshwa, together with an army from the viceroy, marched on Baroda.

For this reason Ratansingh Bhand&#225;ri, the deputy viceroy, transferred him to Kadi and Bij&#225;pur, and in his place appointed Sher Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi, whose father Muhammad Sal&#225;b&#225;t Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi had been a popular governor of V&#237;ramg&#225;m.

When this order reached Sohr&#225;b Kh&#225;n, he forwarded it to Burh&#225;n-ul-Mulk, and in consequence of Burh&#225;n-ul-Mulk&#8217;s remonstrances, the arrangements were changed and Sohr&#225;b Kh&#225;n appointed governor. Upon this Sohr&#225;b Kh&#225;n, leaving S&#225;dak Ali as his deputy in Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h, marched for V&#237;ramg&#225;m; while Ratansingh Bhand&#225;ri, hearing of Sohr&#225;b Kh&#225;n&#8217;s approach, summoned Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n and others to his assistance, and with his own army proceeded to Dholka and plundered Koth. From Koth he advanced and pitched at Har&#225;lah, about ten miles from Sohr&#225;b Kh&#225;n&#8217;s camp, and here he was joined by Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n and others whom he had summoned to support him. <note place="margin">Battle of Dholi.

Safdar Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi and others went to Sohr&#225;b Kh&#225;n and endeavoured to bring him to consent to these terms; but he would not listen, and on both sides preparations were made for battle. During the following night Ratansingh Bhand&#225;ri planned an attack on Sohr&#225;b Kh&#225;n&#8217;s camp. The surprise was complete. Sohr&#225;b Kh&#225;n&#8217;s troops fled, and himself, mortally wounded, shortly afterwards died. By the death of Sohr&#225;b Kh&#225;n the family of K&#225;z&#237;m Beg Kh&#225;n became extinct.

Leaving Rangoji at V&#237;ramg&#225;m, D&#225;m&#225;ji marched into Sorath to levy tribute from the chiefs, and after collecting a portion of his dues, returned to the Dakhan. In the following year (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1736) Rangoji advanced as far as B&#225;vla near Dholka wasting the country. Ratansingh Bhand&#225;ri, the deputy viceroy, marched against him, and forced him to retire to V&#237;ramg&#225;m. Ratansingh pursued the Mar&#225;th&#225;s to V&#237;ramg&#225;m, attacked and defeated them capturing their baggage, but failed to prevent them taking shelter in the town. About this time some Mar&#225;tha horse who were at Sarn&#225;l, otherwise called Th&#225;sra, joined the Kolis of those parts, advanced with them against Kapadvanj and without any serious resistance succeeded in capturing the town. Meanwhile though Ratansingh had summoned Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n to his aid, he delayed coming, as he began to scheme independence at Cambay.

At first he thought this a device to draw him from V&#237;ramg&#225;m, to whose walls his mines had reached. On ascertaining from trusty spies that the report was true, he raised the siege of V&#237;ramg&#225;m, returned rapidly to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, and pushing forward to meet Prat&#225;pr&#225;v, exacted tribute from the chiefs on the banks of the V&#225;trak. As Prat&#225;pr&#225;v drew near, the governor of the Bh&#237;l district retired before him, and he continuing his advance, passed through Valad and Peth&#225;pur, and so by way of Chh&#225;la reached Dholka. Here, through Muhammad Ism&#225;&#237;l, the governor of Dholka, he demanded from the Bhand&#225;ri his share of the revenue. Afterwards, leaving 2000 horse in Dholka, he went to Dhandh&#250;ka. <note place="margin">The G&#225;ikw&#225;r and Peshwa Plunder the Country.</note>In the meantime K&#225;nt&#225;ji, who was a follower of B&#225;jir&#225;v Peshwa, joining with Malh&#225;rr&#225;v Holkar, advanced upon &#205;dar, and coming against D&#225;nta, plundered that town. Some N&#225;gar Br&#225;hmans of the town of Vadnagar, who were settled in D&#225;nta, tried to escape to the hills, but were intercepted and pillaged. The Mar&#225;th&#225;s then proceeded to Vadnagar and plundered the town. From Vadnagar they went as far as P&#225;lanpur, where Pah&#225;r Kh&#225;n Jh&#225;lori, being unable to oppose them, agreed to pay a tribute of &#163;10,000 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 1 <hi>l&#225;kh</hi>).

As he was unable to effect anything by himself he persuaded Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi to join him by a promise of the government of P&#225;tan and directed him to proceed and take up that appointment.

Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n, who had not hitherto produced the order appointing him viceroy, now made it public and began to act as viceroy with the title of Najm-ud-daul&#225;h Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n Bah&#225;dur <corr sic="Fir&#250;z">F&#237;r&#250;z</corr> Jang, and in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1737 sent a copy of this order to Abd&#250;l Husain Kh&#225;n, the deputy minister, and to Mustaf&#237;d Kh&#225;n, who held the office of K&#225;zi.

 </p><p>Sher Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi, wishing to remain neutral, retired to B&#225;l&#225;sinor and Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n summoned Rangoji, who was in the neighbourhood of Cambay, to his assistance. Rangoji agreed to aid him in expelling the M&#225;rv&#225;dis, on condition that, if successful, he should be granted one-half of the produce of Gujar&#225;t except the city of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, the lands in the neighbourhood of the city, and the port of Cambay. This disastrous alliance with the Mar&#225;th&#225;s gave the last blow to Mughal power in Gujar&#225;t, which otherwise might have lingered for at least a quarter of a century. Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n lived to repent his conduct.

 </p><p>When Ratansingh Bhand&#225;ri heard of the appointment of Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n to be viceroy he wrote to Mah&#225;r&#225;ja Abheysingh for orders.

The reply of the Mah&#225;r&#225;ja was that Ratansingh should resist Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n if he could.

At Kaira they encamped on the banks of the V&#225;trak, where, owing to the incessant rain, they were forced to remain for about a month. When the rain abated and the rivers were fordable, Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n, moving to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, encamped in front of the city <pb id="pb319" n="319"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter III.</item><item>Mughal Viceroys.</item><item>Muhammad Sh&#225;h Emperor, 1721&#8211;1748.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n</hi> Fifty-fourth Viceroy, 1737.</item></list> </fw>on the K&#225;nkariya tank and <note place="margin">Lays Siege to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d.</note>prepared for a siege.

Zor&#225;war Kh&#225;n, who had been left at the Mar&#225;tha camp as security for the payment of the tribute, was recalled, and instead the district of Par&#225;ntij was formally assigned to the Mar&#225;th&#225;s in payment of their demands. Some of the Mah&#225;r&#225;ja&#8217;s guns, which were being sent to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d by his agents at Surat through Cambay for facility of transit, were about this time captured by a party of Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n&#8217;s men.

The nobles fearing the consequences, recalled him, and persuaded the emperor to re-appoint him viceroy of Gujar&#225;t.

It was further stated that, as Ratansingh Bhand&#225;ri had acted oppressively, some other person should be appointed deputy to fill his place, and that in the meantime a R&#225;jput noble, named Abhaikaran, was to carry on the government. Shortly before this Muhammad B&#225;kir Kh&#225;n, son of Mu&#226;tamid Kh&#225;n, joined Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n from Surat, while S&#225;dik &#193;li Kh&#225;n and his nephew reinforced him from Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h. When Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n was informed of the purport of the imperial order he agreed to return to Cambay, provided Ratansingh Bhand&#225;ri would quit the city, hand over charge to Abhaikaran, and admit Fid&#225;-ud-d&#237;n Kh&#225;n and his men into the city.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Defence of the City by Ratansingh Bhand&#225;ri.</note>Ratansingh Bhand&#225;ri determined not to leave the city, and prepared to defend himself to the last.

Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n met D&#225;m&#225;ji at &#205;sanpur, three miles from &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, and made great show of friendship, calling him his brother. When Ratansingh Bhand&#225;ri heard of the arrangements made between D&#225;m&#225;ji and Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n, he sent a message to D&#225;m&#225;ji saying, &#8216;Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n has promised Rangoji half of the revenues of Gujar&#225;t excepting the city of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, the lands immediately round it, and Cambay.

Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n now sent the writer of the Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi to Ratansingh Bhand&#225;ri, in hopes that he might withdraw peaceably, but Ratansingh refused to listen to any terms. After some time the Musalm&#225;ns under K&#225;zim &#193;li Kh&#225;n and others, and the Mar&#225;th&#225;s under B&#225;bur&#225;v endeavoured to take the city by storm, but after a bloody contest were forced to retire. Next day Ratansingh, seeing that he could not long hold the city, entered into a negotiation with Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n, and, on receiving a sum of money for his expenses, and on being allowed to retire with the honours of war, left the city.

On the capture of the city, in accordance with Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n&#8217;s engagement, half of it was handed to the Mar&#225;th&#225;s. Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n sent news of what had taken place to the emperor, and appointed Fid&#225;-ud-d&#237;n Kh&#225;n his deputy. D&#225;m&#225;ji, who in the meantime had been to Sorath, now returned and was met by Rangoji, who accompanied him as far as the banks of the Mahi, whence Rangoji proceeded to Dholka. After spending a few days at Dholka, Rangoji returned to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d and took charge of his share of the city, which comprised the R&#225;ikhar, Kh&#225;njch&#225;n, and Jam&#225;lpur quarters as far as the Astoria and R&#225;ipur gates. The city was thus equally divided, and the Astoria and Raipur gates were guarded by the Mar&#225;th&#225;s. At that time the inhabitants of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d were chiefly Muhammadans, and the Mar&#225;th&#225;s, accustomed to extortion, attempting to oppress them, they rose against the strangers, and after a severe affray expelled the greater part of them from the city. Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n, though secretly pleased, affected ignorance and sent Fid&#225;-ud-d&#237;n Kh&#225;n to reassure Rangoji. This with some difficulty he succeeded in doing and Rangoji remained in the city. Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n was sent to P&#225;tan, and, instead of Par&#225;ntij, the district of Kher&#225;lu was granted to Zor&#225;war Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi.

Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n and Sher Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi now joined the viceroy&#8217;s camp, and, about the same time Hathising, chief of Peth&#225;pur, paid a visit to the viceroy and settled his tribute. From Ad&#225;laj they advanced to M&#225;nsa, and were met by the M&#225;nsa chief. From M&#225;nsa they proceeded to Kadi, and from Kadi to B&#237;j&#225;pur. After Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n left the people of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d were badly treated, and Rangoji, leaving his brother Akoji in camp, returned to the capital, whence he marched towards V&#237;ramg&#225;m and Sorath. Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n went from B&#237;j&#225;pur to &#205;dar, and there levied tribute from the chiefs of Mohanpur and Ran&#225;san.

The matter was amicably settled, and the two brothers accompanied the viceroy as far as the &#205;dar frontier, when &#193;nandsingh returned to &#205;dar, and R&#225;isingh, at Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n&#8217;s request, remained with him, Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n undertaking to pay the expenses of his men. Prathir&#225;j, the chief of M&#225;nsa, <note place="margin">The Viceroy collects Tribute, 1738.</note>agreed to pay &#163;2300 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 23,000) and the chief of Varsoda &#163;1000 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 10,000) as tribute. At this time Sher Muhammad Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi was appointed to succeed M&#237;r Dost &#193;li as deputy governor of Sorath. The Mar&#225;th&#225;s, who had attempted to deprive some of the Ras&#250;l&#225;b&#225;d and Batwa Sayads of their land, were attacked by the Muhammadan population, and a few men were wounded on either side. Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n, receiving tribute from various chiefs, had now reached P&#225;lanpur, and <corr sic="P&#225;har">Pah&#225;r</corr> Kh&#225;n Jh&#225;lori, the governor of that place, was introduced to the viceroy by Sher Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi.

Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi, appointing his brother Safdar Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi as his deputy at P&#225;tan, pushed forward in advance for &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. M&#225;m&#250;r Kh&#225;n, who had been chosen by M&#237;r Huzabr &#193;li as his deputy in Sorath, now arrived and complained to Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n regarding Sher Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi&#8217;s appointment. Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n said that, as neither had assumed charge of their duties, they should await final orders from the emperor. He then advanced to H&#225;jipur, and thence encamped on the side of the city near Bahr&#225;mpur and occupied himself in strengthening the city defences. From that camp he proceeded to &#205;sanpur four miles south of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d on his way to levy tribute from the Koli chiefs of the banks of the V&#225;trak. After this he proceeded to K&#250;lej on the V&#225;trak and levied tribute from the Koli chiefs of that neighbourhood. Hearing that D&#225;m&#225;ji had left Songad, and crossing the Mahi had gone to <corr sic="&#193;r&#225;s">Ar&#225;s</corr>, Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n struck his camp and returned to the city, while D&#225;m&#225;ji going to Dholka marched from that to Sorath. <corr sic="Momin">Mom&#237;n</corr> Kh&#225;n now permitted Sher Kh&#225;n to return to his lands in Gogha, whence he proceeded to <corr sic="J&#250;n&#225;ga&#7693;h">Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h</corr> and took charge of the office of deputy governor.

Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n, as the Mar&#225;tha incursions into Sorath increased yearly, and as Sher Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi was a man able to hold his own with them, suffered him to remain as deputy. When D&#225;m&#225;ji returned to V&#237;ramg&#225;m, after levying tribute from the chiefs of Sorath, he was obliged to march against K&#225;nji Koli, the chief of Chhani&#225;r in the Ch&#250;nv&#225;l.

At this time Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n turned his attention to the falling off in the customs revenue of Cambay and appointed Ism&#225;il Muhammad collector of customs. As he was anxious to clear some misunderstanding between Rangoji and himself, Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n set out to visit Rangoji and assure him of his good wishes. At this time Bh&#225;vsingh of V&#237;ramg&#225;m, who found the Mar&#225;th&#225;s even more troublesome than the Muhammadans, as soon as he heard of Malh&#225;rr&#225;v&#8217;s recall, suddenly attacked the fort of V&#237;ramg&#225;m and with the aid of some Arabs and Rohill&#225;s expelled the Mar&#225;tha garrison and prepared to hold the fort on his own account. Shortly after Rangoji demanded that a tower in &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, which had been raised a story by Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n so as to command the residence of the Mar&#225;tha deputy at the Jam&#225;lpur gate, should be reduced to its original height. At the same time he suggested that Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n and he, uniting their forces, should advance and expel Bh&#225;vsingh from V&#237;ramg&#225;m. Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n agreed to both proposals. The addition to the tower was pulled down, and Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n and Rangoji, marching against V&#237;ramg&#225;m, laid siege to the town. Bh&#225;vsingh made a gallant defence, and Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n, who was not sorry to see the Mar&#225;th&#225;s in difficulties, after a time left them and marched to Kadi and Bij&#225;pur to levy tribute. <note place="margin"><corr sic="Bh&#225;vs&#237;ngh">Bh&#225;vsingh</corr> surrenders V&#237;ramg&#225;m and receives P&#225;tdi.</note>Rangoji continued the siege, and as Bh&#225;vsingh saw that even without Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n the Mar&#225;tha army was sufficient to reduce the place, he agreed to surrender V&#237;ramg&#225;m, provided the fort of P&#225;tdi and its dependent villages were granted <pb id="pb324" n="324"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter III.</item><item>Mughal Viceroys.</item><item>Muhammad Sh&#225;h Emperor, 1721&#8211;1748.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n</hi> Fifth-sixth Viceroy, 1738&#8211;1743.</item></list> </fw>to him.

D&#225;m&#225;ji arrived at M&#225;nsa and besieged it. The chiefs and Kolis defended the place bravely for about a month, when it fell into D&#225;m&#225;ji&#8217;s hands, who not only cleared the prickly-pear stockade which surrounded it, but also burned the town. From M&#225;nsa D&#225;m&#225;ji marched to Sorath. On his return he laid siege to Broach, a fort which, from its natural strength as well as from its favourable position on the Narbada, it had been the constant ambition both of D&#225;m&#225;ji and of his father P&#237;l&#225;ji to capture. On the approach of D&#225;m&#225;ji, Nek &#193;lam Kh&#225;n, who held the place in the interests of the Niz&#225;m, prepared to defend the fort, and wrote to the Niz&#225;m for aid. In reply the Niz&#225;m warned D&#225;m&#225;ji not to attack his possessions. On receiving this letter D&#225;m&#225;ji raised the siege and returned to Songad. It seems probable that concessions were made to tempt D&#225;m&#225;ji to retire from Broach, and that the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s share in the Broach customs dates from this siege.

Defeat of the Mar&#225;th&#225;s, 1741.</note>In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1741 in a battle between K&#225;im K&#250;li Kh&#225;n, governor of Dholka, and Rangoji&#8217;s deputy, the Mar&#225;th&#225;s were defeated. Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n, at the request of Rangoji, made peace between them. Fid&#225;-ud-d&#237;n Kh&#225;n, who had recently been raised in rank with the title of Bah&#225;dur, starting to collect tribute burned down the refractory Koli village of Dabhora, and placing a post there, passed to S&#225;tumba, B&#225;l&#225;sinor, and Th&#225;sra. After the battle at Dholka, the building by Rangoji of the fort of Borsad, caused renewed fighting between the Muhammadans and Mar&#225;th&#225;s of Dholka. At the request of Muhammad H&#225;di Kh&#225;n, governor of Dholka, Fid&#225;-ud-d&#237;n Kh&#225;n, passing through Mahudha to Petl&#225;d pushed forward to help him. <note place="margin">Contests between the Musalm&#225;ns and Mar&#225;th&#225;s.</note>In the meantime a battle was fought, in which the Mar&#225;th&#225;s under Malh&#225;rr&#225;v attacked Muhammad H&#225;di Kh&#225;n, and after a short contest withdrew. Next day the Muhammadans, strengthened by the arrival of Fid&#225;-ud-d&#237;n Kh&#225;n, besieged Sojitra. A letter was written to Rangoji, asking the meaning of the attack, and he replied excusing himself and attributing it to the ignorance of Malh&#225;rr&#225;v. Muhammad H&#225;di Kh&#225;n and the author of the Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi eventually met Rangoji at Borsad, and settled that he and Fid&#225;-ud-d&#237;n Kh&#225;n should come together and arrange matters. But Rangoji in his heart intended to fight and wrote to his deputy R&#225;m&#225;ji at &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d to be ready for war. Malh&#225;rr&#225;v now joined Rangoji at Borsad. At this time many misunderstandings and several fights between the Mar&#225;th&#225;s and the Muhammadans were appeased by Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n and Rangoji, who, in spite of the ill-feeling among their subordinates and a certain distrust of each other&#8217;s designs, appear throughout to have maintained a warm <pb id="pb325" n="325"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter III.</item><item>Mughal Viceroys.</item><item>Muhammad Sh&#225;h Emperor, 1721&#8211;1748.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n</hi> Fifth-sixth Viceroy, 1738&#8211;1743.</item></list> </fw>mutual regard. D&#225;m&#225;ji from his stronghold at Songad was too much occupied in Dakhan politics to give much attention to Gujar&#225;t. Rangoji, on the other hand, gained so much influence with the Gujar&#225;t chiefs, that at one time he succeeded in engaging Sajansingh Haz&#225;ri in his service, and also induced R&#225;ja R&#225;isingh of &#205;dar to join him. But Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n detached R&#225;isingh from this alliance, by placing him in charge of the post of Amali&#225;ra and granting him the districts of Mod&#225;sa, Meghrej, Ahmednagar, Par&#225;ntij, and Harsol. Moreover the customary Gujar&#225;t sum at first sent daily by Rangoji to R&#225;ja R&#225;isingh for the expenses of his troops had begun to fall into arrears. R&#225;ja R&#225;isingh made his peace with Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n through the mediation of Nazar &#193;li Kh&#225;n, Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n&#8217;s nephew, who appears to have been one of the leading spirits of the time.

After this Rangoji left the city, appointing as before R&#225;m&#225;ji as his deputy, and joining Jagj&#237;wan Pav&#225;r went to Borsad, where he had built a fort. At this time one J&#237;vand&#225;s came with authority from the Niz&#225;m to act as collector of Dholka, part of the lands assigned to the Niz&#225;m as a personal grant, but failed to enforce his position. Shortly after this R&#225;ja &#193;nandsing of &#205;dar was killed, and his brother R&#225;ising, taking leave, went to &#205;dar to settle matters. Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n had his patent increased to the personal rank of commander of 6000 with a contingent of 6000 cavalry. He received a dress of honour, a jewelled turban, a plume, six pieces of cloth, an elephant, the order of M&#225;hi-mar&#225;tib,<note id="n325.1" n="1">The M&#225;hi-mar&#225;tib was a banner having the likeness of a fish at its top.</note> and the title of Najm-ud-daulah Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n Bah&#225;dur Dil&#225;war Jang. Differences again broke out between Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n and Rangoji, and again matters were settled by a friendly meeting between the two chiefs at Borsad, where Rangoji had taken up his residence. Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n now went to Petl&#225;d, and from that to Cambay, where he was taken ill, but after six weeks came to Vasu, where Rangoji visited him. Here though again unwell he went to Dholka, and shortly afterwards he and Rangoji marched upon <corr sic="L&#237;mbdi">Limb&#7693;i</corr>, which at this time is mentioned as under V&#237;ramg&#225;m.

Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n now marched into Gohilv&#225;&#7693;a, and proceeded by Loli&#225;na to Gogha, then under the charge of a resident deputy of Sher Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi. Here he received tribute from the chief of Sihor, and from that, marching into H&#225;l&#225;r, went against Nav&#225;nagar. <note place="margin">The Viceroy collects Tribute in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a.</note>The J&#225;m resisted for twenty days, and eventually, on his agreeing to pay &#163;5000 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 50,000) as tribute, Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n returned to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. During his absence in spite of stubborn resistance Nazar &#193;li Kh&#225;n and Vajer&#225;m had collected tribute from the Koli chiefs. Rangoji, who had now left D&#225;m&#225;ji, joined battle with B&#225;pu N&#225;ik ere he crossed the Mahi, and B&#225;pu N&#225;ik turned back. Rangoji therefore remained at Borsad, but hearing that Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n&#8217;s illness had become serious, he went once or twice to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d to visit him.

At this time a man named &#193;nandr&#225;m, who had been disgraced by Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n, went over to Rangoji and incited him to murder Fid&#225;-ud-d&#237;n Kh&#225;n and Muftakhir Kh&#225;n. Rangoji with this intention invited them both to his house, but his heart failed him, and shortly afterwards Fid&#225;-ud-d&#237;n Kh&#225;n went to Cambay. Rangoji now determined at all hazards to assassinate Muftakhir Kh&#225;n. With this object he took Muftakhir Kh&#225;n&#8217;s associates, Vajer&#225;m and K&#225;im K&#250;li Kh&#225;n, into his confidence. Muftakhir Kh&#225;n accidentally heard of his designs, and remained on his guard. As Rangoji had failed to carry out his promise to raise Sher Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi to the post of deputy viceroy, Sher Kh&#225;n advanced to Dholka and began plundering some Cambay villages. Rangoji, after another futile attempt to assassinate Muftakhir Kh&#225;n, sent for his deputy R&#225;m&#225;ji, who was then in the neighbourhood, and prepared to fight. <note place="margin">Muftakhir Kh&#225;n Defeats the Mar&#225;th&#225;s.</note>Muftakhir Kh&#225;n, on his part, summoned Fid&#225;-ud-d&#237;n Kh&#225;n from Cambay, and in a few days they succeeded in uniting their forces.

Rangoji, being hard pressed, agreed to give up &#193;nandr&#225;m and to surrender both Borsad and V&#237;ramg&#225;m, Sher Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi becoming his security.

Abdul &#193;z&#237;z accordingly set out from Junnar, taking with him Fatehy&#225;b Kh&#225;n, commander of the fort of Mulher in B&#225;gl&#225;n and Rustamr&#225;v Mar&#225;tha. Directing his march in the first instance to Surat he was there watched in the interests of D&#225;m&#225;ji G&#225;ikw&#225;r, by Dev&#225;ji T&#225;kpar, the lieutenant of that chief, who, seeing that on leaving Surat, Abd&#250;l &#193;z&#237;z continued to advance to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, <note place="margin">Battle of K&#237;m Kathodra.</note>pursued him to K&#237;m Kathodra, about fifteen miles north-west of Surat, and there attacked him.

Abd&#250;l &#193;z&#237;z Kh&#225;n retired, but was so closely followed by the Mar&#225;th&#225;s, that at P&#225;noli he was forced to leave his elephant, and, mounting a horse, fled with all speed towards Broach. On reaching the Narbada he failed to find any boats, and, as his pursuers were close upon him, putting his horse at the water, <note place="margin">Defeat and Death of Abd&#250;l &#193;z&#237;z Kh&#225;n, 1744.</note>he tried to swim the river; but, sticking fast in the mud, he was overtaken and slain by the Mar&#225;th&#225;s.

Ere he could carry this plan into effect, the emperor receiving, it is said, a present of &#163;20,000 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 2 <hi>l&#225;khs</hi>) for the nomination, appointed Fakhr-ud-daulah Fakhr-ud-d&#237;n Kh&#225;n Shuj&#225;&#226;t Jang Bah&#225;dur fifty-eighth viceroy of Gujar&#225;t. The new viceroy forwarded a blank paper to a banker of his acquaintance named Sit&#225;r&#225;m, asking him to enter in it the name of a fitting deputy. <note place="margin">Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi, Deputy Viceroy.</note>Sit&#225;r&#225;m filled in the name of Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n, and Fakhr-ud-daulah was proclaimed viceroy. About this time Safdar Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi, after levying tribute from the S&#225;barmati chiefs, returned to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, and Khander&#225;v G&#225;ikw&#225;r, as he passed from Sorath to Songad, appointed Rangoji his deputy. On being appointed deputy Rangoji sent Krishn&#225;ji instead of Mor&#225;r N&#225;ik as his deputy to <corr sic="Ahmed&#225;bad">&#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d</corr>, and himself proceeded to Arhar-M&#225;tar on the V&#225;trak, and from that moved to Kaira to visit Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n, with whom he established friendly relations. In the same year &#193;li Muhammad Kh&#225;n, superintendent of customs, died, and in his place the author of the Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi was appointed. In this year, too, Pah&#225;r Kh&#225;n Jh&#225;lori died, and his uncle, Muhammad Bah&#225;dur, was appointed governor of P&#225;lanpur in his stead.

As D&#225;m&#225;ji G&#225;ikw&#225;r could not be spared from the Dakhan Khander&#225;v was appointed his deputy in Gujar&#225;t, and he chose one R&#225;mchandra to represent him at &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. When Fakhr-ud-daulah advanced to join his appointment as viceroy he was received at B&#225;l&#225;sinor with much respect by Sher Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi. Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi, on the other hand, determining to resist Fakhr-ud-daulah to the utmost of his power, summoned Gang&#225;dhar with a body of Mar&#225;tha horse from Petl&#225;d, and posting them at &#205;sanpur, about ten miles south-west of the city, himself leaving the fortifications of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, encamped at <pb id="pb329" n="329"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter III.</item><item>Mughal Viceroys.</item><item>Muhammad Sh&#225;h Emperor, 1721&#8211;1748.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Fakhr-ud-daulah</hi> Fifty-eighth Viceroy, 1744&#8211;1748.</item></list> </fw>As&#225;rva, about a mile and a half from the walls. During his progress towards the capital the new viceroy was joined by R&#225;isinghji of &#205;dar at Kapadvanj, and, advancing together, they arrived at Bh&#237;lpur, eighteen miles east of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. On their approach Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n sent Safdar Kh&#225;n and <corr sic="Gang&#225;dar">Gang&#225;dhar</corr> to oppose them, and the two armies met about six miles from the capital. After some fighting Fakhr-ud-daulah succeeded in forcing his way to the suburb of R&#225;jpura, and next day continuing to drive back the enemy occupied the suburb of Bahr&#225;mpura and began the actual siege of the city. At this point affairs took a turn. Fakhr-ud-daulah was wounded and returned to his camp, while Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n succeeded in winning over to his side Sher Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi and R&#225;isinghji of &#205;dar, two of the viceroy&#8217;s chief supporters. The Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi especially notes that R&#225;ja R&#225;isingh asked for money to pay his troops but Fakhr-ud-daulah, not knowing that this rule had long been a dead letter, said that as he held a district on service tenure, it was not proper for him to ask for a money aid when on imperial service. <note place="margin">Defeat and capture of the Viceroy by Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi.</note>Next day Fakhr-ud-daulah was surrounded by Safdar Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi and the Mar&#225;th&#225;s, and himself one wife and some children were taken prisoners, while another of his wives and his son, who had managed to escape to Sidhpur, were captured and brought back to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d.

Reaching Borsad, he took Rangoji with him as far as &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, where he met Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n, and obtained from Rangoji his share of the tribute. Khander&#225;v was not satisfied with Rangoji&#8217;s accounts, and appointing a fresh deputy, he attached Rangoji&#8217;s property, and before leaving &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d for Sorath, put him in confinement at Borsad. He also confined Fakhr-ud-daulah in the Ghi&#225;spur outpost on the bank of the river Mahi. Meanwhile in consequence of some misunderstanding between Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi and his brother Safdar Kh&#225;n, the latter retired to Udepur, and Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n went to Visalnagar then in the hands of his brother Zor&#225;war Kh&#225;n. From Visalnagar, Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n proceeded to R&#225;dhanpur, and meeting his brother Safdar Kh&#225;n, they became reconciled, and returned together to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. Khander&#225;v G&#225;ikw&#225;r, who had in the meantime returned from Sorath, encamping at Dholka appointed Trimbakr&#225;v Pandit as his deputy at &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d in place of Moro Pandit. On hearing that Rangoji had been thrown into confinement, Um&#225;b&#225;i sent for him, and he along with Khander&#225;v G&#225;ikw&#225;r repaired to the Dakhan.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Pun&#225;ji Vithal and Fakhr-ud-daulah oppose Rangoji and Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n.</note>Shortly afterwards Pun&#225;ji Vithal, in concert with Trimbak Pandit, being dissatisfied with Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n, began to intrigue with Fakhr-ud-daulah. In the meantime Um&#225;b&#225;i had appointed Rangoji as her deputy, and, as he was a staunch friend of Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n, he expelled Trimbakr&#225;v from &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, and himself collected the Mar&#225;tha share of the city revenues. Upon this Pun&#225;ji Vithal sent Gang&#225;dhar and Krishn&#225;ji with an army, and they, expelling the Muhammadan officers from the districts from which the Mar&#225;th&#225;s levied the one-fourth share of the revenue, took the management of them into their own hands. Rangoji now asked Sher Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi to help him.

As Rangoji failed to join him, Sher Kh&#225;n proceeded by himself to Kapadvanj, and from Kapadvanj marched against the Mar&#225;tha camp, with which Fakhr-ud-daulah was then associated. On the night after his arrival, the Mar&#225;th&#225;s made an attack on Sher Kh&#225;n&#8217;s camp, in which many men on both sides were slain. Next morning the battle was renewed, but on Sher Kh&#225;n suggesting certain terms the fighting ceased. That very night, hearing that Rangoji had reached B&#225;l&#225;sinor, Sher Kh&#225;n stole off towards Kapadvanj. Pun&#225;ji and Fakhr-ud-daulah followed in pursuit but failed to prevent Rangoji and Sher Kh&#225;n from joining their forces.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Siege of Kapadvanj by Fakhr-ud-daulah, 1746.</note>In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1746 a battle was fought in the neighbourhood of the town of Kapadvanj in which Sher Kh&#225;n was wounded. He was forced to take shelter with Rangoji in Kapadvanj, while Fakhr-ud-daulah, Gang&#225;dhar, and Krishn&#225;ji laid siege to that town. At this time the Lun&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a chief asked Malh&#225;rr&#225;v Holkar on his way back from his yearly raid into M&#225;lwa, to join him in attacking Virpur. Holkar agreed and Virpur was plundered. Rangoji, hearing of the arrival of Holkar, begged him to come to his aid, and on promise of receiving a sum of &#163;20,000 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 2 <hi>l&#225;khs</hi>) and two elephants, Holkar consented. <note place="margin">At the approach of Holkar the Siege is raised.</note>Gang&#225;dhar, Krishn&#225;ji, and Fakhr-ud-daulah, hearing of the approach of Holkar, raised the siege of Kapadvanj, and marching to Dholka expelled the governor of that district. Shortly afterwards on a summons from D&#225;m&#225;ji and Khander&#225;v G&#225;ikw&#225;r Rangoji retired to Baroda. Meanwhile Fakhr-ud-daulah, Krishn&#225;ji, and Gang&#225;dhar advanced to Jetalpur in the Daskroi sub-division of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d and, taking possession of it, expelled &#193;mbar Habshi, the deputy of Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n. D&#225;m&#225;ji and Khander&#225;v G&#225;ikw&#225;r passed from Baroda to Vasu, where they were met by Krishn&#225;ji and Gang&#225;dhar, whom D&#225;m&#225;ji censured for aiding Fakhr-ud-daulah. On this occasion D&#225;m&#225;ji bestowed the districts of Baroda Na&#7693;i&#225;d and Borsad on his brother Khander&#225;v, an action which for ever removed any ill feeling on the part of Khander&#225;v. Then, proceeding to Goklej, D&#225;m&#225;ji had an interview with Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n. From Goklej he sent K&#225;noji T&#225;kpar with Fakhr-ud-daulah to Sorath, and himself returned to Songa&#7693;. As Borsad had been given to Khander&#225;v, Rangoji fixed on Umreth as his residence.

 </p><p>In this year, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1746, Teghbeg Kh&#225;n, governor of Surat, died, and was succeeded by his brother Safdar Muhammad Kh&#225;n, who, in acknowledgment of a present of seven horses, received from the emperor the title of Bah&#225;dur. At this time T&#225;lib &#193;li Kh&#225;n died, and the writer of the Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi was appointed minister by the emperor. In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1747 Rangoji returned to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, and Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n had an interview with him a few miles from the city.

He afterwards went to Umreth and lived with Rangoji. K&#225;noji T&#225;kpar, who had gone with Fakhr-ud-daulah into Sorath, now laid siege to and took the town of Vanthali. As it was nearly time for the Mar&#225;th&#225;s to return to their country, K&#225;noji and Fakhr-ud-daulah, retiring to Dholka, expelled Muhammad J&#225;nb&#225;z, the deputy governor. Rangoji, who had at this time a dispute with Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n regarding his share of tribute, now came and joined them, and their combined forces marched upon S&#225;nand, where, after plundering the town, they encamped. It was now time for K&#225;noji to withdraw to the Dakhan. Rangoji and Fakhr-ud-daulah, remaining behind to collect tribute from the neighbouring districts, marched to &#205;sanpur, where they were opposed by Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n. <note place="margin">Increased Strength of Fakhr-ud-daulah&#8217;s Party.</note>On this occasion both Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n and Fakhr-ud-daulah sought the alliance of R&#225;ja R&#225;isingh of &#205;dar.

Sher Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi also joined Fakhr-ud-daulah, who, thus reinforced, laid siege to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. While these events were passing at &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, Hariba, an adopted son of Khander&#225;v G&#225;ikw&#225;r, at that time in possession of the fort of Borsad, began to plunder Rangoji&#8217;s villages under Petl&#225;d, and, attacking his deputy, defeated and killed him. <note place="margin">Dissensions among the Mar&#225;th&#225;s.</note>On this Rangoji withdrew from &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, attacked and captured the fort of Borsad, and forced Hariba to leave the country.

Sayad Miththan was forced to return unsuccessful. After Teghbeg Kh&#225;n&#8217;s death Sayad Miththan again came to Surat and lived there with his brother Sayad Achchan, who held the office of paymaster. Sayad Miththan tried to get the government of the town into his hands, but, again failing, committed suicide. His brother Sayad Achchan then attacked and took the citadel, expelling the commander; and for several days war was waged between him and the governor Safdar Muhammad Kh&#225;n with doubtful success. At last Sayad Achchan called to his aid Malh&#225;rr&#225;v, the deputy at Baroda, and their combined forces took possession of the whole city.

 </p><p>Meanwhile, on account of some enmity between Mulla Fakhr-ud-d&#237;n, the son of Mulla Muhammad &#193;li, chief of the merchants, and Sayad Achchan, the Mulla was thrown into prison.

When Fakhr-ud-daulah, the former viceroy, heard of the appointment of Mah&#225;r&#225;ja Vakhatsingh, seeing no chance of any benefit from a longer stay in Gujar&#225;t, he retired to Dehli. In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1748 &#193;sif J&#225;h, Niz&#225;m-ul-Mulk, died at an advanced age, leaving six sons and a disputed succession.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Disorder Spreads.</note>About the same time B&#225;l&#225;jir&#225;v Peshwa, who was jealous of the power of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r, sent a body of troops, and freed Rangoji from the hands of Khander&#225;v G&#225;ikw&#225;r. During these years adventurers, in different parts of the country, taking advantage of the decay of the central power, endeavoured to establish themselves in independence. Of these attempts the most formidable was the revolt of one of the P&#225;tan Kasb&#225;tis who established his power so firmly in P&#225;tan that Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n found it necessary to proceed in person to reduce him. Shortly afterwards Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n deemed it advisable to recall his brothers Safdar Kh&#225;n and <corr sic="Zor&#225;w&#225;r">Zor&#225;war</corr> Kh&#225;n, who were then at &#218;nja under P&#225;tan, and took them with him to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. Fid&#225;-ud-d&#237;n Kh&#225;n who had been residing at Atarsumba now asked permission to return to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, but as Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n did not approve of this suggestion, Fid&#225;-ud-d&#237;n departed to Broach and there took up his residence. Jan&#225;rdhan Pandit marched to Kaira and the Bh&#237;l district to levy tribute, and Khander&#225;v appointed Shevakr&#225;m his deputy.

R&#225;ja Raghunathd&#225;s accordingly nominated his own nephew, R&#225;ja Harpras&#225;d, to be governor, and the writer of the Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi to be his deputy. But before R&#225;ja Harpras&#225;d could join his appointment at Surat, both he and his father were slain in battle.

He chose Patel Sukhdev to collect the Mar&#225;tha revenue and asked the Peshwa to help him in expelling D&#225;m&#225;ji&#8217;s agents. The Peshwa, being now engaged in war in the Dakhan with Sal&#225;bat Jang Bah&#225;dur, son of the late Niz&#225;m, was unable to send Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n any assistance. Towards the close of the year Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n started from &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d to collect tribute from the S&#225;barmati chiefs. Returning early in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1751, at the request of Jetha Patel a subordinate of Bh&#225;vsingh Des&#225;i, he proceeded to Banod or Vanod under V&#237;ramg&#225;m and reduced the village. &#193;li Muhammad Kh&#225;n, the author of the Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi, who about this time was raised in rank with the title of Bah&#225;dur, states that owing to the Mar&#225;tha inroads most of the districts had passed entirely into their possession; in others according to agreements with Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n they held a half share. Consequently in spite of new taxes, the entire remaining income of the province was only four <hi>l&#225;khs</hi> of rupees, and it was impossible to maintain the military posts or control the rebellious Kolis.

Taking advantage of the absence of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r and his army in the Dakhan, Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n marched into Sorath. He first visited Gogha, and then levying tribute in Gohilv&#225;&#7693;a advanced into K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a and marched against Nav&#225;nagar, and, after collecting a contribution from the J&#225;m, returned to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d: In the following year (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1752), as soon as the news reached Gujar&#225;t that the Mar&#225;th&#225;s&#8217; share in the province had been divided between the Peshwa and G&#225;ikw&#225;r, Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n, who was always quarrelling with the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s agent, sending Varajl&#225;l his steward to B&#225;l&#225;jir&#225;v Peshwa begged him to include Cambay in his share and send his agent in place of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s agent. B&#225;l&#225;jir&#225;v agreed, and from that time an agent of the Peshwa was established at Cambay. In the same year Raghun&#225;thr&#225;v, brother of the Peshwa, entering Gujar&#225;t took possession of the Rewa and Mahi K&#225;ntha districts and marched on Surat. Shiaji Dhangar was appointed in Shevakr&#225;m&#8217;s place as D&#225;m&#225;ji&#8217;s deputy, and Krishn&#225;ji came to collect the Peshwa&#8217;s share.

Meanwhile Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n&#8217;s anxiety regarding the Mar&#225;th&#225;s was for a time removed by the departure of P&#225;ndurang Pandit. And, as the harvest season had arrived, he with his brother Zor&#225;war Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi, leaving Muhammad Mub&#225;riz Sherw&#225;ni behind as his deputy, set out from &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d to levy tribute from the chiefs of the S&#225;bar K&#225;ntha. Certain well informed persons, who had heard of Raghun&#225;thr&#225;v&#8217;s preparations for invading Gujar&#225;t, begged Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n not to leave the city but to depute his brother Zor&#225;war Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi to collect the tribute. Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n, not believing their reports, said that he would not go more than from forty-five to sixty miles from the city, and that, should the necessity of any more distant excursion arise, he would entrust it to his brother. <corr sic="J&#225;wan">Jaw&#225;n</corr> Mard Kh&#225;n then marched from the city, levying tribute until he arrived on the P&#225;lanpur frontier about seventy-five miles north of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. Here meeting Muhammad Bah&#225;dur Jh&#225;lori, the governor of P&#225;lanpur, Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n was foolishly induced to join him in plundering the fertile districts of Sirohi, till at last he was not less than 150 miles from his head-quarters. Meanwhile Raghun&#225;thr&#225;v, joining D&#225;m&#225;ji G&#225;ikw&#225;r, entered suddenly by an unusual route into Gujar&#225;t, and news reached &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d that the Mar&#225;th&#225;s had crossed the Narbada. On this the townspeople sent messenger after messenger to recall Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n, and building up the gateways prepared for defence, while the inhabitants of the suburbs, leaving their houses, crowded with their families into the city for protection. Raghun&#225;thr&#225;v, hearing that Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n and his army were absent from the city, pressed on by forced marches, and crossing the river Mahi despatched an advance corps under Vithal Sukhdev. Kos&#225;ji, proprietor of Na&#7693;i&#225;d, at D&#225;m&#225;ji G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s invitation also marched towards &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, plundering Mehm&#250;d&#225;b&#225;d Khokhri, only three miles from the city. In the meantime Vithal Sukhdev reached Kaira, and taking with him the chief man of that place, Muhammad Daur&#225;n, son of Muhammad B&#225;bi, continued his march. He was shortly joined by Raghun&#225;thr&#225;v, and the combined forces now proceeded to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d and encamped by the K&#225;nkariya <pb id="pb336" n="336"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter III.</item><item>Mughal Viceroys.</item><item>Ahmed Sh&#225;h Emperor, 1748&#8211;1754.</item></list> </fw>lake.

This boy who was about nine years old died. Malik Seif-ud-d&#237;n ran to Sh&#225;h-i-&#193;lam, who used then to live at As&#225;wal, two or three miles east of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, and in a transport of grief and rage said to the Saint: &#8216;Is this the way you deceive people? Surely you obtained me the gift of that boy to live and not to die? This I suppose is how you will keep your promise of mediating for our sinful souls before All&#225;h also?&#8217; The Saint could give no reply and retired to his inner apartments. The stricken father went to the Saint&#8217;s son Sh&#225;h Bh&#237;kan, who, going in to his father, entreated him to restore the Malik&#8217;s boy to life. The Saint asked his son &#8216;Are you prepared to die for the boy?&#8217; Sh&#225;h Bh&#237;kan said &#8216;I am ready.&#8217; The Saint, going into an inner room, spread his skirts before All&#225;h crying &#8216;R&#225;janji,&#8217; a pet name by which the Saint used to address All&#225;h, meaning Dear King or Lord, &#8216;R&#225;janji, here is a goat for a goat; take thou this one and return the other.&#8217; Lamentations in the Saint&#8217;s harem showed that half of the prayer was granted and the Malik on returning to his house found the other half fulfilled.</note> on the bank of the S&#225;barmati to the south-west of the city. Raghun&#225;thr&#225;v now proceeded to invest the city, distributing his thirty to forty thousand horse into three divisions. The operations against the north of the city were entrusted to D&#225;m&#225;ji G&#225;ikw&#225;r; those on the east to Gop&#225;l Hari; while the troops on the south and west were under the personal command of Raghun&#225;thr&#225;v and his officers.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Return of Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n.</note>After leaving Sirohi Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n had gone westwards to Thar&#225;d and V&#225;v, so that the first messengers failed to find him. One of the later messengers, M&#225;ndan by name, who had not left &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d until the arrival of Raghun&#225;thr&#225;v at the K&#225;nkariya lake, made his way to V&#225;v and Thar&#225;d, and told Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n what had happened. Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n set out by forced marches for R&#225;dhanpur, and leaving his family and the bulk of his army at P&#225;tan, he pushed on with 200 picked horsemen to Kadi and from that to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, contriving to enter the city by night. <note place="margin">He enters &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d.</note>The presence of Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n raised the spirits of the besieged, and the defence was conducted with ardour.

On his refusal, the Mar&#225;tha general redoubled his efforts and sprung several mines, but owing to the thickness of the city walls no practicable breach was effected.

 </p><p>Raghun&#225;thr&#225;v was so little hopeful of taking &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d that he had determined, should the siege last a month longer, to depart on condition of receiving the one-fourth share of the revenue and a safe conduct. Had Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n only disbursed his own money to pay the troops, and encouraged instead of disheartening the official class, he need never have lost the city. At last to Raghun&#225;thr&#225;v&#8217;s relief, Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n was reduced to treat for peace through Vithal Sukhdev. It was arranged that the Mar&#225;th&#225;s should give Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n the sum of &#163;10,000 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 1 <hi>l&#225;kh</hi>) to pay his troops, besides presenting him with an elephant and other articles of value. It was at the same time agreed that the garrison should leave the city with all the honours of war. And that, for himself and his brothers, Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n should receive, free from any Mar&#225;tha claim, the districts of P&#225;tan, Vadnagar, Sami, Munjpur, Visalnagar, Thar&#225;d, Kher&#225;lu, and R&#225;dhanpur with Tervada and Bij&#225;pur. It was further agreed that one of Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n&#8217;s brothers should always serve the Mar&#225;th&#225;s with 300 horse and 500 foot, the expenses of the force being paid by the Mar&#225;th&#225;s. It was also stipulated that neither the Peshwa&#8217;s army nor his deputy&#8217;s, nor that of any commander should enter Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n&#8217;s territory, and that in &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d no Mar&#225;tha official should put up at any of the Kh&#225;n Bah&#225;dur&#8217;s mansions, new or old, or at any of those belonging to his brothers followers or servants.

From Dholka Raghun&#225;thr&#225;v went to T&#225;r&#225;pur, about twelve miles north of Cambay, and compelled Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n to submit to an annual payment of &#163;1000 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 10,000). At the same time &#193;li Muhammad Kh&#225;n Bah&#225;dur, the author of the Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi, was appointed collector of customs, and his former grants were confirmed and he was allowed to retain <pb id="pb338" n="338"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Chapter III.</item><item>Mughal Viceroys.</item><item>Ahmed Sh&#225;h Emperor, 1748&#8211;1754.</item></list> </fw>his villages of Sayadpur and K&#251;j&#225;dh close to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d, as well as the village of P&#225;nm&#251;l in Bij&#225;pur. D&#225;m&#225;ji G&#225;ikw&#225;r, after levying tribute in the V&#225;trak K&#225;ntha, went to Kapadvanj, which he took from Sher Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi. From Kapadvanj he passed to Na&#7693;i&#225;d and appointed Shevakr&#225;i to collect his half share of the revenue of Gujar&#225;t. <note place="margin">Mughal Coinage Ceases.</note>In the &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d mint, coin ceased to be struck in the emperor&#8217;s name and the suburbs of the city which had been deserted during the siege were not again inhabited. The Kolis commenced a system of depredation, and their outrages were so daring that women and children were sometimes carried off and sold as slaves. After the rains were over (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1754) Shetuji, commander of the &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d garrison, and Shankarji, governor of V&#237;ramg&#225;m, were sent to collect tribute from Sorath. Though the imperial power was sunk so low, the emperor was allowed to confer the post of K&#225;zi of the city on K&#225;zi R&#251;kn-ul-Hak Kh&#225;n who arrived at &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d and assumed office. <note place="margin">Failure of an Attempt on Cambay, 1753.</note>At the close of the year Shripatr&#225;v, who was anxious to acquire Cambay, marched against Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n.

At this time Shetuji and Shankarji returned from Sorath, where they had performed the pilgrimage to Dw&#225;rka. Shetuji was sent to the Bh&#237;l district against the Kolis. He was unsuccessful, and was so ashamed of his failure that he returned to the Dakhan and Dandu D&#225;t&#225;tri was appointed in his place.

 </p><p>In this year died Nek &#193;lam Kh&#225;n II. governor of Broach. He was succeeded by his brother Khertalab Kh&#225;n who expelled his nephew H&#225;mid Beg, son of Nek &#193;lam Kh&#225;n. H&#225;mid Beg took refuge in Surat. At B&#225;l&#225;sinor a dispute arose between Sher Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi and a body of Arab mercenaries who took possession of a hill, but in the end came to terms. With the Peshwa&#8217;s permission his deputy Bhagvantr&#225;v marched on Cambay. But Varajl&#225;l, Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n&#8217;s steward, who was then at Poona, sent word to his master, who prepared himself against any emergency. When Bhagvantr&#225;v arrived at Cambay he showed no hostile intentions and was well received by Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n. Subsequently a letter from Bhagvantr&#225;v to S&#225;lim Jam&#225;d&#225;r at &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d ordering him to march against Cambay fell into Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n&#8217;s hands. He at once surrounded Bhagvantr&#225;v&#8217;s house and made him prisoner. <note place="margin">Mar&#225;th&#225;s Attack Cambay, 1754.</note>When the Peshwa heard that Bhagvantr&#225;v had been captured, he ordered Ganesh &#193;pa, governor of Jambusar, as well as the governors of V&#237;ramg&#225;m, Dhandhuka, and other places to march at once upon Cambay. They went and besieged the town for three months, but without success. Eventually Shripatr&#225;v, the Peshwa&#8217;s deputy, sent the author of the Mir&#259;t-i-&#193;hmedi to negotiate, and it was agreed that Bhagvantr&#225;v should be released and that no alteration should be made in the position of Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n.

About this time Khertalab Kh&#225;n, governor of Broach, died, and quarrels arose regarding the succession. Ultimately Hamid Beg, nephew of Khertalab Kh&#225;n, obtained the post, and he afterwards received an imperial order confirming him as governor, and bestowing on him the title of Nekn&#225;m Kh&#225;n Bah&#225;dur.

After his release Bhagvantr&#225;v established himself in the Cambay fort of N&#225;p&#225;d and not long after began to attack Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n&#8217;s villages. <note place="margin">Contest with Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n Renewed, 1754.</note>After several doubtful engagements peace was concluded on Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n paying &#163;1000 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 10,000) on account of the usual share of the Mar&#225;th&#225;s which he had withheld. This arrangement was made through the mediation of Tuk&#225;ji, the steward of Sad&#225;shiv D&#225;modar, who had come to Gujar&#225;t with an army and orders to help Bhagvantr&#225;v. As Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n had no ready money Tuk&#225;ji offered himself as security and Bhagvantr&#225;v and Tuk&#225;ji withdrew to the Dakhan. Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n&#8217;s soldiery now clamoured for pay. As he was not in a position to meet their demands he sent a body of men against some villages to the west belonging to Limb&#7693;i and plundered them, dividing the booty among his troops.

Gogha fell and leaving a garrison of 100 Arabs under Ibr&#225;h&#237;m K&#250;li Kh&#225;n, Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n returned to Cambay, levying tribute. He then sent the bulk of his army under the command of Muhammad Zam&#225;n Kh&#225;n, son of Fid&#225;-ud-d&#237;n Kh&#225;n, and Varajl&#225;l his own steward, to plunder and collect money in Gohilv&#225;&#7693;a and K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a. Here they remained until their arrears were paid off, and then returned to Cambay. After this Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n plundered several Petl&#225;d villages and finally, in concert with the Kolis of Dhowan, attacked Jambusar and carried off much booty. Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n next marched against Borsad, and was on the point of taking the fort when Say&#225;ji, son of D&#225;m&#225;ji G&#225;ikw&#225;r, who lived at Baroda, hearing of Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n&#8217;s success, came rapidly with a small body of men to the relief of the fort and surprised the besiegers. The Muhammadan troops soon recovered from the effects of the surprise, and Say&#225;ji fearing to engage them with so small a force retired. On Say&#225;ji&#8217;s departure Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n raised the siege of Borsad and returned to Cambay.

He sent spies to ascertain the strength of the garrison and set about making allies of the chief men in the province and enlisting troops. About this time R&#225;ghoji, the Mar&#225;tha deputy, was assassinated by a Rohilla. As soon as Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n heard of R&#225;ghoji&#8217;s death he sent his nephew, Muhammad Zam&#225;n Kh&#225;n, with some men in advance, and afterwards himself at the close of the year, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1756, marched from Cambay and camped on the V&#225;trak.

The Kolis commenced plundering, and a hand-to-hand fight ensued, in which the Mar&#225;th&#225;s were worsted and were eventually expelled from the city. The Kolis attempted to plunder the Dutch factory, but met with a spirited resistance, and when Shambh&#250;r&#225;m, a N&#225;gar Br&#225;hman, one of Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n&#8217;s chief supporters, heard it he ordered the Kolis to cease attacking the factory and consoled the Dutch.

On reaching Kalol he was joined by Harbhamr&#225;m, governor of Kadi. They resolved to send Zor&#225;war Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi to recall Sad&#225;shiv D&#225;modar, and to await his arrival at V&#237;ramg&#225;m. Shevakr&#225;m, the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s deputy, had taken refuge at Dholka.

On their way they were met, and, after several combats, defeated by a detachment of Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n&#8217;s army. Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n sent troops to overrun Kadi, but Harbhamr&#225;m, the governor of Kadi, defeated the force, and captured their guns. When the emperor heard of the capture of Gogha, he sent a sword as a present to Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n; and when the news of the capture of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d reached &#193;gra, Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n received many compliments. <corr sic="B&#225;l&#225;jirav">B&#225;l&#225;jir&#225;v</corr> Peshwa on the other hand was greatly enraged at these reverses.

Up to this time Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n was receiving &#163;150 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 1500) daily for the pay of his own and his brother&#8217;s troops. Sad&#225;shiv R&#225;mchandra, considering the number of the troops too small for so large a payment, reduced the amount and retained the men in his own service. After a month&#8217;s siege, Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n&#8217;s troops began to clamour for pay, but Shambh&#250;r&#225;m, by collecting the sum of &#163;10,000 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 1 <hi>l&#225;kh</hi>) from the inhabitants of the town managed for the time to appease their demands. When they again became urgent for pay, Shambh&#250;r&#225;m diverted their thoughts by a general sally from all the gates at night.

In this state of affairs an order arrived from the imperial court bestowing on Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n a dress of honour and the title of Bah&#225;dur. Although the imperial power had for years been merely a name Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n asked and obtained permission from the besiegers to leave the city and meet the bearers of the order. The Mar&#225;th&#225;s redoubled their efforts. Still though the besiegers were successful in intercepting supplies of grain the garrison fought gallantly in defence of the town.

Shortly afterwards Sad&#225;shiv R&#225;mchandar made an attempt on the fort of K&#225;likot. The fort was successfully defended by Jam&#225;d&#225;r N&#250;r Muhammad, and the Mar&#225;th&#225;s were repulsed. The Mar&#225;th&#225;s endeavoured in vain to persuade Shambh&#250;r&#225;m to desert Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n, and though the garrison were often endangered by the faithlessness of the Kolis and other causes, they remained staunch. Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n, though frequently in difficulties owing to want of funds to pay his soldiery, continued to defend the town.

Before he started Shuja-&#251;d-daulah, the Naw&#225;b of Lucknow, requested him on his way to visit B&#225;l&#225;jir&#225;v, and endeavour to come to some settlement of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d affairs. Accordingly, adopting the name of Sh&#225;h N&#250;r, and assuming the dress of an ascetic, Hassan K&#250;li made his way to Poona, and appearing before the Peshwa offered to make peace at &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. Sh&#225;h N&#250;r with much difficulty persuaded the Peshwa to allow Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n to retain Cambay and Gogha without any Mar&#225;tha share, and to grant him a <hi>l&#225;kh</hi> of rupees for the payment of his troops, on condition that he should surrender &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. He obtained letters from the Peshwa addressed to Sad&#225;shiv R&#225;mchandra to this effect, and set out with them for &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d. When he arrived Sad&#225;shiv R&#225;mchandra was unwilling to accede to the terms, as the &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d garrison were reduced to great straits. Sh&#225;h N&#250;r persuaded him at last to agree, provided Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n would surrender without delay. Accordingly Sh&#225;h N&#250;r entered the city and endeavoured to persuade Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n. Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n demanded in addition a few Petl&#225;d villages, and to this the Mar&#225;th&#225;s refused their consent. Sh&#225;h N&#250;r left in disgust. Before many days Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n was forced to make overtures for peace.

In the early part of the year Sayad Mu&#238;n-ud-d&#237;n, otherwise called Sayad Achchan, visited the Peshwa at Poona, and received from him the appointment of governor of Surat. Sayad Achchan then set out for his charge, and as he was aided by a body of Mar&#225;tha troops under the command of Muzaffar Kh&#225;n G&#225;rdi and had also secured the support of Nekn&#225;m Kh&#225;n, the governor of Broach, he succeeded after some resistance in expelling &#193;li Naw&#225;z Kh&#225;n, son of the late Safdar Muhammad Kh&#225;n, and establishing himself in the government. During the recent troubles, the English factory had been plundered and two of their clerks murdered by Ahmed Kh&#225;n Habshi, commandant of the fort. <note place="margin">The English take command of Surat, 1759.</note>The English therefore determined to drive out the Habshi and themselves assume the government of the castle.

The Peshwa appears to have consented to this conquest.

The Mar&#225;th&#225;s, informed of the chief&#8217;s design, detaching a force, attacked Halvad at night, and breaching the walls forced open the gates. The chief retired to his palace, which was fortified, and there defended himself, but was at last forced to surrender, and was detained a prisoner until he should pay a sum of &#163;12,000 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 1,20,000). The neighbouring chiefs, impressed with the fate of Halvad, paid tribute without opposition. <note place="margin">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a, 1759.</note>Sad&#225;shiv R&#225;mchandra now went to <corr sic="J&#250;n&#225;ga&#7693;h">Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h</corr>, but ere he could commence operations against the fortress, the rainy season drew near, and returning to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d he prepared to depart for Poona.

On receiving the news of the capture of the Surat fort by the English the emperor issued an order, in the name of the governor of Bombay, confirming the command of the fort to the English instead of to the Habshis of Janjira, appointing the Honourable East India Company admirals of the imperial fleet, and at the same time discontinuing the yearly payment of &#163;2000 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 20,000) formerly made to the Habshi on this account. When in the course of the following year, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760, this imperial order reached Surat, Mr. Spencer and other chief men of the city went outside of the walls to meet and escort the bearers of the despatch. Sad&#225;shiv R&#225;mchandra was appointed viceroy of &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d on behalf of the Peshwa.

He was accompanied by Harbhamr&#225;m whom D&#225;m&#225;ji G&#225;ikw&#225;r had specially sent from his own court to act as K&#225;md&#225;r to Say&#225;ji. When Sad&#225;shiv R&#225;mchandra reported to the Peshwa the conquest of B&#225;l&#225;sinor by Bhagvantr&#225;v he was highly pleased, and gave Bhagvantr&#225;v a dress of honour and allowed him to keep the elephant which he had captured at Lun&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a; and passed a patent bestowing B&#225;l&#225;sinor upon him.

From Surat he passed to Cambay by land through Broach.

This officer acted in a friendly manner to Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n, and marching to Cambay, he fixed the Mar&#225;tha share of the revenues of that place for that year at &#163;8400 (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 84,000), and then went to &#193;hmed&#225;b&#225;d by way of D&#225;kor.

Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n now issued from P&#225;tan and levied small contributions from the holdings in V&#225;gad, as far as Anj&#225;r in Kachh. From V&#225;gad he proceeded to Sorath, and in concert with Muhammad Mah&#225;bat Kh&#225;n of <corr sic="J&#250;n&#225;ga&#7693;h">Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h</corr> and Muhammad Muz&#225;ffar Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi, between whom he made peace, he levied tribute in Sorath as far as Loliy&#225;na, and returned to P&#225;tan.

Taking advantage of the confusion that followed, the Dehli court despatched instructions to the chief Musalm&#225;n nobles of Gujar&#225;t, directing Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n, <corr sic="J&#225;wan">Jaw&#225;n</corr> Mard Kh&#225;n, and the governor of Broach to join in driving the Mar&#225;th&#225;s out of the province.

In reply his envoy was shown the despatch received from Dehli, and was made the bearer of a message, that before it was too late, it would be wisdom for the Mar&#225;th&#225;s to abandon Gujar&#225;t. Things were in this state when D&#225;m&#225;ji G&#225;ikw&#225;r, wisely forgetting his quarrels with the Peshwa, marched to the aid of Sad&#225;shiv with a large army. Advancing against Cambay he attacked and defeated Mom&#237;n Kh&#225;n, plundering one of his villages. But the Mar&#225;th&#225;s were too weak to follow up this success, or exact severer punishment from the Musalm&#225;n confederates. &#193;pa Ganesh invited Sard&#225;r Muhammad Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi to Kaira, and on condition of the payment of tribute, agreed to allow him to keep possession of B&#225;l&#225;sinor. Subsequently D&#225;m&#225;ji&#8217;s energy enabled him to enlarge the power and possessions of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s house, besides acquisitions from other chiefs, recovering the districts of Visalnagar, Kher&#225;lu, Vadnagar, Bij&#225;pur, and P&#225;tan from Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n. After the death of the great D&#225;m&#225;ji, the importance of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s power sensibly diminished. Had it not been for their alliance with the British, the feeble hands of Say&#225;jir&#225;v I. (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1771&#8211;1778) would probably have been the last to hold the emblem of G&#225;ikw&#225;r rule.

 </p><p>When in 1529 Nono daCunha came as viceroy to India he held instructions to make himself master of the island of Diu. In the following year a great expedition, consisting of 400 vessels and 15,600 men, met in Bombay and sailed to the K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a coast. After vigorous assaults it was repulsed off Diu on the 17th February 1531. From that day the Portuguese made ceaseless efforts to obtain a footing on the island of Diu. In 1531 besides harrying the sea trade of Gujar&#225;t the Portuguese sacked the towns of T&#225;r&#225;pur, Bals&#225;r, and Surat, and, to give colour to their pretensions, received under their protection Ch&#225;nd Kh&#225;n an illegitimate brother of Bah&#225;dur. In 1532, under James de Silveira, the Portuguese burned the south K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a ports of Pattan-Somn&#225;th, Mangrul, Tal&#225;ja, and Muzaffar&#225;b&#225;d, killing many of the people and carrying off 4000 as slaves. Shortly after the Portuguese took and destroyed Bassein in Th&#225;na obtaining 400 cannon and much ammunition. They also burned Daman, Th&#225;na, and Bombay. &#8220;All this&#8221; says the Portuguese historian &#8220;they did to straiten Diu and to oblige the king of Gujar&#225;t to consent to their raising a fort on the island of Diu.&#8221; When Bah&#225;dur was engaged with the Mughals (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1532&#8211;1534) the Portuguese Governor General deputed an embassy to wait on Hum&#225;y&#250;n to endeavour to obtain from him the cession of Diu, hoping by this action to work indirectly on the fears of Bah&#225;dur. At last in 1534 Bah&#225;dur consented to a peace by which he agreed to cede the town of Bassein to Portugal; not to construct ships of war in his ports; and not to combine with Turkish fleets against Portugal.

 </p><p>Permission was also given to the Portuguese to build in Diu. In consideration of these terms the Portuguese agreed to furnish Bah&#225;dur with 500 Europeans of whom fifty were men of note. According to the Portuguese historian it was solely because of this Portuguese help that Bah&#225;dur succeeded in driving the Mughals out of Gujar&#225;t. Bah&#225;dur&#8217;s cession of land in Diu to the Portuguese was for the purpose of building a mercantile factory. From the moment Bah&#225;dur discovered they had raised formidable fortifications, especially when by the withdrawal of the Mughals he no longer had any motive for keeping on terms with them, he resolved to wrest the fort out of the hands of the Portuguese. On the plea of separating the natives from the Europeans, Bah&#225;dur instructed his governor of Diu to build a wall with a rampart capable of being mounted with guns. But as this created much dispute and ill-will the rampart was given up. Bah&#225;dur next attempted to seize Emanuel de Souza the captain of Diu fort. With this object he invited DeSouza to his camp. DeSouza was warned but determined to accept Bah&#225;dur&#8217;s invitation. He went attended by only one servant, an act of courage which <pb id="pb348" n="348"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix I.</item><item>The Death of Sult&#225;n Bah&#225;dur, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1526&#8211;1536.</item></list> </fw>Bah&#225;dur so greatly admired that he treated him with honour and allowed him to return in safety. Bah&#225;dur next schemed to secure DeSouza in the fort by surprise. With this end he began to pay the Portuguese officers visits at all hours. But DeSouza was always on his guard and Bah&#225;dur&#8217;s surprise visits failed to give him an opportunity. In 1536 DeSouza wrote to the viceroy complaining of the bad feeling of the Gujar&#225;t Moors towards the Portuguese in Diu and of the efforts of the king to drive them out of the fort. In consequence of DeSouza&#8217;s letter Nono daCunha the viceroy arrived at Diu early in 1536&#8211;7. Bah&#225;dur went to visit the viceroy on board the viceroy&#8217;s ship. On his return he was attacked and leaping into the water was killed by a blow on the head and sank.

 </p><p>Of the unplanned and confused circumstances in which the brave Bah&#225;dur met his death four Musalm&#225;n and four Portuguese versions remain. The author of the Mir&#259;t-i-Sikandari (Persian Text, 280&#8211;281) states that the Portuguese, who offered their help to Bah&#225;dur in the days of his defeat by the emperor Hum&#225;y&#250;n, obtained from him the grant of land at Diu, and on this land built a fort. After the re-establishment of his power the Sult&#225;n, who had no longer any need of their help, kept constantly planning some means of ousting the Portuguese from Diu. With this object Bah&#225;dur came to Diu and opened negotiations with the Portuguese viceroy, hoping in the end to get the viceroy into his power. The viceroy knowing that Bah&#225;dur regretted the concessions he had made to them was too wary to place himself in Bah&#225;dur&#8217;s hands. To inspire confidence Bah&#225;dur, with five or six of his nobles all unarmed, paid the viceroy a visit on board his ship. Suspecting foul play from the behaviour of the Portuguese the king rose to retire, but the Portuguese pressed upon him on all sides. He had nearly reached his boat when one of the Portuguese struck him a blow with a sword, killed him, and threw his body overboard.

 </p><p>The same author gives a second version which he says is more generally received and is probably more accurate. According to this account the Portuguese had come to know that Bah&#225;dur had invited the Sult&#225;ns of the Dakhan to co-operate with him in driving the Portuguese from the Gujar&#225;t, Konkan, and Dakhan ports. That the Portuguese viceroy had come with 150 ships and had anchored at Diu off the chain bastion. That Sult&#225;n Bah&#225;dur not suspecting that the Portuguese were aware of his insincerity went in a barge to see the fleet, and when he got in the midst of their ships, the Portuguese surrounded his barge and killed him with lances.

 </p><p>According to Farishtah (II. 442, 443, <abbr>Pers.</abbr> Text) on the invasion of Gujar&#225;t by the emperor Hum&#225;y&#250;n, Sult&#225;n Bah&#225;dur had asked help of the Portuguese. When his power was re-established, Bah&#225;dur, hearing of the arrival of between five and six thousand Portuguese at Diu, feared they would take possession of that port. He therefore hastened to Diu from <corr sic="J&#250;n&#225;ga&#7693;h">Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h</corr>. The Portuguese who were aware that Hum&#225;y&#250;n had withdrawn and that Bah&#225;dur had re-established his power, preferred to attempt to gain Diu by stratagem rather than by force. Bah&#225;dur asked the viceroy to visit him. The viceroy feigned sickness and Bah&#225;dur with the object of proving his goodwill offered to visit the viceroy on board his ship. On leaving the viceroy&#8217;s ship to enter his own barge the Portuguese suddenly moved their vessel and Bah&#225;dur fell overboard. While in the water a Portuguese struck the king with a lance and killed him.

The Portuguese chief was apprehensive that as the Sult&#225;n was no longer in want of assistance he meditated treachery. So he sent to inform the Sult&#225;n that he had come as requested, but that he was ill and unable to go on shore, so that the interview must be deferred till he got better. The Sult&#225;n, quitting the royal road of safety, embarked on the 12th February 1536 (3rd Ramazan H. 943) with a small escort to visit the viceroy on board the viceroy&#8217;s ship. As soon as Bah&#225;dur reached the vessel he found the viceroy&#8217;s sickness was a pretence and regretted that he had come. He at once sought to return. But the Portuguese were unwilling that such a prey should escape them and hoped that by keeping him prisoner they might get more ports. The viceroy came forward and asked the Sult&#225;n to stay a little and examine some curiosities he had to present. The Sult&#225;n replied that the curiosities might be sent after him and turned quickly towards his own boat. A European <hi>k&#225;zi</hi> or priest placed himself in the Sult&#225;n&#8217;s way and bade him stop. The Sult&#225;n, in exasperation, drew his sword and cleft the priest in twain. He then leaped into his own boat. The Portuguese vessels drew round the Sult&#225;n&#8217;s boat and a fight began. The Sult&#225;n and R&#250;mi Kh&#225;n threw themselves into the water. A friend among the Portuguese stretched a hand to R&#250;mi Kh&#225;n and saved him: the Sult&#225;n was drowned in the waves.

 </p><p>Of the four Portuguese versions of Bah&#225;dur&#8217;s death the first appears in Correa&#8217;s (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1512&#8211;1550) Lendas Da Asia, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1497 to 1550; the second in DeBarros&#8217; (died <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1570) Decadas, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1497 to 1539; the third in Do Couto&#8217;s (died <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1600&#160;?) continuation of DeBarros, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1529 to 1600; and the fourth in Faria-e-Souza&#8217;s (died <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1650) Portuguese Asia to <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1640. A fifth reference to Bah&#225;dur&#8217;s death will be found in Castaneda&#8217;s <foreign lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Historia</foreign> which extends to <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1538.

 </p><p>As Correa was in India from <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1512 till his death in Goa in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1550, and as his narrative which was never published till <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1856&#8211;64 has the highest reputation for accuracy of detail his version carries special weight. According to Correa (<foreign lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Lendas Da Asia</foreign>, Vol. III. <abbr>Chap.</abbr> XCV.) during the monsoon of 1536, Nono DaCunha the viceroy received by land a letter from Manoel deSouza the captain of Diu fort, telling him of the discontent of the Gujar&#225;t Moors with king Bah&#225;dur for allowing the Portuguese to build a fort at Diu. In consequence of this information early in the fair season Nono daCunha sailed from Goa in his own galleon accompanied by about ten small vessels <hi>fustas</hi> and <hi>katurs</hi> under the command of Antonio deSylveira. Nono reached Diu about the end of December. King Bah&#225;dur was glad that the viceroy should come to Diu almost alone since it seemed to show he was not aware of Bah&#225;dur&#8217;s designs against the Portuguese. When Bah&#225;dur arrived at Diu he sent a message to the viceroy inviting him to come ashore to meet him as he had important business to transact. The king&#8217;s messenger found the viceroy ill in bed, and brought back a message that the viceroy would come ashore to meet the king in the evening. Immediately after the king&#8217;s messenger left, Manoel deSouza, the captain of Diu fort, came on board to see the viceroy. The viceroy told Manoel to go and thank the king and to return his visit. The king expressed his grief at the viceroy&#8217;s illness and proposed to start at once to see him. He went to his barge and rowed straight to the viceroy&#8217;s <pb id="pb350" n="350"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix I.</item><item>The Death of Sult&#225;n Bah&#225;dur, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1526&#8211;1536.</item></list> </fw>galleon. The king had with him, besides the interpreter St. Jago, seven men and two pages one carrying a sword and the other a bow. The captain of the fort and some other officers in their own barges followed the king. Bah&#225;dur, who was the first to arrive, came so speedily that the viceroy had hardly time to make preparations to receive him. He put on heavy clothes to show he was suffering from ague and ordered all the officers to be well armed. When Bah&#225;dur came on board he saw the men busy with their weapons but showed no signs that he suspected foul play. He went straight to the viceroy&#8217;s cabin. The viceroy tried to get up but Bah&#225;dur prevented him, asked how he was, and returned at once to the deck. As Bah&#225;dur stood on the deck the captain of the fort boarded the galleon, and, as he passed to the cabin to see the viceroy, Bah&#225;dur laughingly upbraided him with being behind time. Then without taking leave of the viceroy Bah&#225;dur went to his barge. When the viceroy learned that the king had left he told the captain to follow the king and to take him to the fort and keep him there till the viceroy saw him. The captain rowed after the king who was already well ahead. He called to the king asking him to wait. The king waited. When the captain came close to the king&#8217;s barge he asked the king to come into his vessel. But the interpreter without referring to the king replied that the captain should come into the king&#8217;s barge. DeSouza ordered his boat alongside. His barge struck the king&#8217;s barge and DeSouza who was standing on the poop tripped and fell into the water. The rowers of the royal barge picked him out and placed him near the king who laughed at his wet clothes. Other Portuguese barges whose officers thought the Moors were fighting with the captain began to gather. The first to arrive was Antonio Cardoza. When Cardoza came up the interpreter told the king to make for land with all speed as the Portuguese seemed to be coming to seize and kill him. The king gave the order to make for the shore. He also told the page to shoot the hollow arrow whose whistling noise was a danger signal. When the Moors in the king&#8217;s barge heard the whistle they attacked Manoel deSouza, who fell dead into the sea. Then Diogo de Mesquita, D&#8217;Almeida, and Antonio Correa forced their way on to the king&#8217;s barge. When the king saw them he unsheathed his sword and the page shot an arrow and killed Antonio Cardoza, who fell overboard and was drowned. D&#8217;Almeida was killed by a sword-cut from a Moor called Tiger and Tiger was killed by Correa. At that moment Diogo de Mesquita gave the king a slight sword-cut and the king jumped into the sea. After the king, the interpreter and R&#250;mi Kh&#225;n, two Moors, and all the rowers leapt into the water. The Portuguese barges surrounded them and the men struck at the three swimmers with lances and oars. The king twice cried aloud &#8216;I am Sult&#225;n Bah&#225;dur,&#8217; hoping that some one would help him. A man who did not know that he was the king struck Bah&#225;dur on the head with a club. The blow was fatal and Bah&#225;dur sank. The second version is given by Barros (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1560) in his Decadas da Asia, Vol. V. page 357 of the 1707 edition. The third version by Do Couto (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1600) in his continuation of Barros&#8217; Decadas, and the fourth by Faria-e-Souza (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1650) in his Portuguese Asia are in the main taken from De Barros. The following details are from Steevens&#8217; (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1697) translation of Faria given in Briggs&#8217; Muhammadan Power in India, IV. 135&#8211;138.

 </p><p>Bah&#225;dur king of Cambay, who had recovered his kingdom solely by the assistance of the Portuguese, now studied their ruin, and repenting of the leave he had granted to build a fort at Diu endeavoured to <pb id="pb351" n="351"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix I.</item><item>The Death of Sult&#225;n Bah&#225;dur, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1526&#8211;1536.</item></list> </fw>take it and to kill the commander and the garrison. Nono da Cunha the Portuguese viceroy understood his designs and prepared to prevent them. Emanuel deSouza who commanded at Diu was warned by a Moor that the king would send for him by a certain Moor and kill him. DeSouza determined to go, and, when sent for, appeared with only one servant. Admiring DeSouza&#8217;s courage the king treated him honourably and allowed him to return in safety. The king&#8217;s mother tried to dissuade her son from plotting against DeSouza but to no effect. To remove suspicion Bah&#225;dur began to pay the Portuguese officers visits at unseasonable hours, but was ever received by DeSouza on his guard. Meanwhile, on the 9th January 1536, Nono daCunha the Portuguese viceroy set out from Goa for Diu with 300 sail. When he put in at Cheul he found Niz&#225;m-ul-Mulk who pretended he had come to divert his women at sea but really with designs on that place. When Nono reached Diu the king was hunting in the mountains and Nono apprised him of his arrival. The king sent for him by a Portuguese apostate of the name of John de St. Jago called Firangi Kh&#225;n, but Nono daCunha pleaded illness. The king pretending great friendship came to Diu accompanied by Emanuel deSouza, who had brought the last message from DaCunha. At Diu the king went on board the viceroy&#8217;s ship and for a time they discoursed. The king was troubled at a page whispering something to DaCunha, but as DaCunha took no notice his suspicions were allayed. The message was from DeSouza, stating that the captains whom he had summoned were awaiting orders to secure or kill the king. DaCunha thought it strange that DeSouza had not killed the king while he was in his power in the fort; and DeSouza thought it strange that DaCunha did not now seize the king when he was in his power in the ship. DaCunha directed all the officers to escort the king to the palace and then accompany DeSouza to the fort, where DaCunha intended to seize the king when he came to visit him. The king on his part had resolved to seize DaCunha at a dinner to which he had invited him and send him in a cage to the Great Turk. De Souza who was going to invite the king to the fort after DaCunha had entered it, came up with the king&#8217;s barge and delivered his invitation through R&#250;mi Kh&#225;n. R&#250;mi Kh&#225;n warned the king not to accept it. The king disregarding this warning invited DeSouza into his barge. While stepping into the king&#8217;s barge DeSouza fell overboard, but was picked up by officers who carried him to the king. At this time three Portuguese barges came up and some of the officers seeing DeSouza hastily enter the king&#8217;s barge drew close to the king&#8217;s barge. The king remembering R&#250;mi Kh&#225;n&#8217;s warning ordered Emanuel deSouza to be killed. James <corr sic="deMesquita">de Mesquita</corr> understanding the order flew at and wounded the king. An affray followed and four Portuguese and seven of the king&#8217;s men were killed. The king tried to get away in a boat but a cannon shot killed three of his rowers and he was stopped. He next attempted to escape by swimming, but being in danger of drowning discovered himself by crying for help. A Portuguese held out an oar to him; but others struck him fatal blows, so that he sank.

 </p><p>The conclusion to be drawn from these four Musalm&#225;n and four Portuguese versions is that on either side the leader hoped by some future treachery to seize the person of the other; and that mutual suspicion turned into a fatal affray a meeting which both parties intended should pass peacefully and lull the other into a false and favourable security.

The hill-top is three to four miles from north to south and four to five miles from east to west. On the north, the east, and the west, M&#225;ndu is islanded from the main plateau of M&#225;lwa by valleys and ravines that circle round to its southern face, which stands 1200 feet out of the N&#237;m&#225;r plain. The area of the hill-top is over 12,000 English acres, and, so broken is its outline, that the encircling wall is said to have a length of between thirty-seven and thirty-eight miles. Its height, 1950 feet above the sea, secures for the hill-top at all seasons the boon of fresh and cool air.

 </p><p>About twenty miles south of Dh&#225;r the level cultivated plateau breaks into woody glades and uplands. Two miles further the plain is cleft by two great ravines, which from their deeper and broader southern mouths 700 to 800 feet below the Dh&#225;r plateau, as they wind northwards, narrow and rise, till, to the north of M&#225;ndu hill, they shallow into a woody dip or valley about 300 yards broad and 200 feet below the south crest of M&#225;lwa. From the south crest of the M&#225;lwa plateau, across the tree tops of this wild valley, stand the cliffs of the island M&#225;ndu, their crests crowned by the great Dehli gateway and its long lofty line of flanking walls. At the foot of the sudden dip into the valley the &#194;lamg&#237;r or World-Guarding Gate stands sentinel.<note id="n352.1" n="1"><p>The following Persian verses are carved on the &#194;lamg&#237;r gateway:

 <q><text><body><lg type="Group"><l>In the time of &#193;lamg&#237;r Aurangz&#237;b (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1658&#8211;1707), the ruler of the World,     </l><l>This gate resembling the skies in altitude was built anew.     </l><l>In the year <hi rend='sc'>a.h.</hi>&#160;1079 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1668) the work of renewal was begun and completed     </l><l>By the endeavour of the exalted Kh&#225;n Muhammad Beg Kh&#225;n.     </l><l>From the accession of this Emperor of the World Aurangz&#237;b.     </l><l>This was the eleventh year by way of writing and history. </l></lg></body></text></q></p></note> Beyond the gateway, among wild reaches of rock and forest, a noble causeway with high domed tombs on either hand fills the lowest dip of the valley. From the south end of the causeway the road winds up to a second gateway, and beyond the second gateway between side walls climbs till at the crest of the slope it passes through the ruined but still lofty and beautiful Dehli or northern gateway, one of the earliest works of Dil&#225;war Kh&#225;n (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1400), the founder of Musalm&#225;n M&#225;ndu.

 </p><p>Close inside of the Dehli gate, on the right or west, stands the handsome Hindola Palace. The name Hindola, which is probably the title of the builder, is explained by the people as the Swingcot palace, because, like the sides of the cage of a swinging cot, the walls of the hall bulge <pb id="pb353" n="353"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix II.</item><item>The Hill Fort of M&#225;ndu.</item><item><hi><hi rend="sc">Description.</hi></hi></item></list> </fw>below and narrow towards the top. Its great baronial hall and hanging windows give the Hindola palace a special merit and interest, and an air of lordly wealth and luxury still clings to the tree-covered ruins which stretch west to large underground cisterns and hot weather retreats. About a quarter of a mile south stand the notable group of the Jah&#225;z Mehel or Ship palace on the west, and the Tapela Mehel or Caldron palace on the south, with their rows of lofty pointed arches below deep stone caves, their heavy windowless upper stories, and their massive arched and domed roof chambers. These palaces are not more handsomely built than finely set. The massive ship-like length of the Jah&#225;z Mehel lies between two large tree-girt ponds, and the Tapela, across a beautiful foreground of water and ruin, looks east into the mass of tangled bush and tree which once formed part of the 130 acres of the L&#225;l B&#225;gh or Royal Gardens.

 </p><p>The flat palace roofs command the whole 12,000 acres of M&#225;ndu hill, north to the knolls and broken uplands beyond the great ravine-moat and south across the waving hill-top with its miles of glades and ridges, its scattered villages hamlets and tombs, and its gleaming groves of mangoes, <hi>khirnis</hi>, banyans, <hi>mhowras</hi>, and <hi>pipals</hi>. In the middle distance, out from the tree-tops, stand the lofty domes of Hoshang&#8217;s tomb and of the great J&#225;m&#225; mosque. Further south lies the tree-girt hollow of the S&#225;gar Tal&#225;v or Sea Lake, and beyond the S&#225;gar lake a woody plateau rises about 200 feet to the southern crest, where, clear against the sky, stand the airy cupolas of the pavilion of R&#250;p Mati, the beautiful wife of B&#225;z Bah&#225;dur (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1551&#8211;1561), the last Sult&#225;n of M&#225;lwa. Finally to the west, from the end of the R&#250;p Mati heights, rises even higher the bare nearly isolated shoulder of Songad, the citadel or inner fort of M&#225;ndu, the scene of the Gujar&#225;t Bah&#225;dur&#8217;s (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1531) daring and successful surprise. This fair hill-top, beautiful from its tangled wildness and scattered ruins, is a strange contrast to M&#225;ndu, the capital of a warlike independent dynasty. During the palmy days of the fifteenth century, of the 12,000 acres of the M&#225;ndu hill-top, 560 were fields, 370 were gardens, 200 were wells, 780 were lakes and ponds, 100 were baz&#225;r roads, 1500 were dwellings, 200 were rest-houses, 260 were baths, 470 were mosques, and 334 were palaces. These allotments crowded out the wild to a narrow pittance of 1560 acres of knolls and ridges.

 </p><p>From the Jah&#225;z Mehel the road winds through fields and woods, gemmed with peafowl and droll with monkeys, among scattered palaces mosques and tombs, some shapely some in heaps, about a mile south to the walled enclosure of the lofty domed tomb of the establisher of M&#225;ndu&#8217;s greatness, Hoshang Sh&#225;h Ghori (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1405&#8211;1432). Though the badly-fitted joinings of the marble slabs of the tomb walls are a notable contrast to the finish of the later Mughal buildings, Hoshang&#8217;s tomb, in its massive simplicity and dim-lighted roughness, is a solemn and suitable resting-place for a great Path&#225;n warrior. Along the west of the tomb enclosure runs a handsome flat-roofed colonnade. The pillars, which near the base are four-sided, pass through an eight-sided and a sixteen-sided belt into a round upper shaft. The round shaft ends in a square under-capital, each face of which is filled by a group of leafage in outline the same as the favourite Hindu <hi>Singh-m&#250;kh</hi> or horned face. Over the entwined leafy horns of this moulding, stone brackets support heavy stone beams, all Hindu in pattern.<note id="n353.1" n="1">Mr. Fergusson (Indian Architecture, page 543) says: &#8220;The pillars appear to have been taken from a Jain building.&#8221; But the refinement on the square capital of each pillar of the Hindu <hi>Singh-m&#250;kh</hi> or horned face into a group of leaves of the same <pb/>outline shows that the pillars were specially carved for use in a Muslim building. The porch on the north side of the tomb enclosure is described (Ditto, page 543) as composed of pillars avowedly re-erected from a Jain building. This note of Mr. Fergusson&#8217;s must have gone astray, as the north porch of Hoshang&#8217;s tomb enclosure is in the plain massive pointed arch and square-shafted style of the tomb and of the great mosque. Mr. Fergusson&#8217;s note apparently belongs to the second and smaller J&#225;m&#225; Masjid, about a hundred yards east of the Sea or <hi>Sag&#225;r</hi> lake, the pillars of whose colonnade and porch are still enlivened by rows of the lucky face of the Hindu old horny.</note> Close to the east of Hoshang&#8217;s tomb is Hoshang&#8217;s <pb id="pb354" n="354"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix II.</item><item>The Hill Fort of M&#225;ndu.</item><item><hi><hi rend="sc">Description.</hi></hi></item></list> </fw>J&#225;m&#225; Masjid or Great Mosque, built of blocks of red limestone. Hoshang&#8217;s mosque is approached from the east through a massive domed gateway and across a quadrangle enclosed on the east north and south by wrecked colonnades of pointed arches. The west is filled by the great pointed arches of the mosque in fair repair. On the roof of the mosque from a thick undergrowth of domelets rise three lofty domes.<note id="n354.1" n="1"><p>Hoshang&#8217;s great mosque has the following much damaged Persian inscription:

 <q><text><body><lg type="Group"><l>The mosque of exalted construction, the temple of heavenly altitude,     </l><l>Whose every thick pillar is a copy of the (pillars of the) Sacred Temple (the Temple of Makkah).     </l><l>On account of the greatness of its dignity, like the pigeons of the Temple of Makkah,     </l><l>Sacred angels of high degree are always engaged in hovering around it,     </l><l>The result of the events born of the merciless revolution of the skies.     </l><l>When the sun of his life came as far as the balcony (i. e. was ready to set).     </l><l>&#193;azam Hum&#225;y&#250;n (that is Malik Mughi&#8217;s) said ...     </l><l>The administration of the country, the construction of buildings, and the driving back of enemies     </l><l>Are things which I leave you (the son of &#193;azam Hum&#225;y&#250;n) as parting advice with great earnestness.     </l><l>The personification of the kindness of Providence, the Sult&#225;n <corr sic="&#193;l&#225;-ud-d&#237;n">Al&#225;-ud-d&#237;n</corr> (Mehm&#250;d I. <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1436&#8211;1469), who is     </l><l>The outcome of the refulgence of the Faith, and the satisfier of the wants of the people,     </l><l>In the year <hi rend='sc'>a.h.</hi>&#160;858.

 </p><p>In front of the gateway of the Great Mosque, in the centre of a masonry plinth about three feet high, stands an iron pillar about a foot in diameter at the base and twenty feet high. Close to the east of the gateway is the site of Mehm&#250;d&#8217;s (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1442) Tower of Victory, traces of which remained as late as <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1840. About fifty yards further east are the ruins of a great building called the Ashrafi Mehel, said to have been a Musalm&#225;n college. To the north-east a banner marks a temple and the local state offices. South the road passes between the two lines of small houses and huts that make modern M&#225;ndu. Beyond the village, among ruins and huge swollen baobab stems, the road winds south along a downward slope to the richly-wooded lowland, where stretches to the west the wide coolness of the S&#225;gar Tal&#225;v or Sea lake. Its broad surface covering 600 acres is green with fanlike lotus leaves, reeds, and water-grasses. Its banks are rough with brakes of tangled bush from which, in uncramped stateliness, rise lofty <hi>mhauras</hi>, mangoes, <hi>kirnis</hi>, and <hi>p&#237;pals</hi>. To the east round a smaller tank, whose banks are crowned by splendid mangoes and tamarinds, stand the domes of several handsome tombs.

See Elliot, Vol. II. page 325 Note 1. The Persian text of Farishtah (I. 115), though by mistake calling it M&#225;ndu (not <sic>M&#225;ndu</sic>), notes that it was the Mandu in the Siw&#225;lik hills. The poetical date-script also terms it Bil&#225;di-Siw&#225;lik or the Siw&#225;lik countries.

The king sent a robe and a horse, and Am&#237;n gave up walking and took to riding. He made his friends ride, enlisted horsemen, and promoted the cultivation of the country (Elliot, IV. 552). Farishtah (<abbr>Pers.</abbr> Text, II. 460&#8211;61) states that when Sult&#225;n Muhammad, the son of <corr sic="Fir&#250;z">F&#237;r&#250;z</corr> Tughlak, made Khw&#225;jah Sarwar his chief minister with the title of Khw&#225;jah Jeh&#225;n, and gave Zafar Kh&#225;n the viceroyalty of Gujar&#225;t and Khizr Kh&#225;n that of Mult&#225;n, he sent Dil&#225;war Kh&#225;n to be governor of M&#225;lwa. In another passage Farishtah (II. 461) states that one of Dil&#225;war&#8217;s grandfathers, Sult&#225;n Shah&#225;b-ud-d&#237;n, came from Ghor and took service in the court of the Dehli Sult&#225;ns. His son rose to be an <hi>Am&#237;r</hi>, and his grandson Dil&#225;war Kh&#225;n, in the time of Sult&#225;n F&#237;r&#250;z, became a leading nobleman, and in the reign of Muhammad, son of F&#237;r&#250;z, obtained M&#225;lwa in fief. When the power of the Tughlaks went to ruin Dil&#225;war assumed the royal emblems of the umbrella and the red-tent.</note> strengthening the defences and adorning the hill with buildings, as he always entertained the desire of making M&#225;ndu his capital.<note id="n357.4" n="4"><p>Dil&#225;war Kh&#225;n Ghori, whose original name was Husein, was one of the grandsons of Sult&#225;n Shah&#225;b-ud-d&#237;n Muhammad bin S&#225;m. He was one of the nobles of Muhammad, the son of <corr sic="Fir&#250;z">F&#237;r&#250;z</corr> Tughlak, who after the death of that monarch, settled in and asserted his power over M&#225;lwa. (<abbr>Pers.</abbr> Text Faristah, II. 460). The emperor Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r (who calls him &#194;m&#237;d Sh&#225;h Ghori) attributes to him the construction of the fort of Dh&#225;r. He says (Memoirs <abbr>Pers.</abbr> Text, 201&#8211;202): Dh&#225;r is one of the oldest cities of India. R&#225;ja Bhoj, one of the famous ancient Hindu kings, lived in this city. From his time up to this a thousand years have passed. Dh&#225;r was also the capital of the Muhammadan rulers of M&#225;lwa. When Sult&#225;n Muhammad Tughlak (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1325) was on his way to the conquest of the Dakhan he built a cut-stone fort on a raised site. Its outline is very elegant and beautiful, but the space inside is empty of buildings. &#194;m&#237;d Sh&#225;h Ghori, known as Dil&#225;war Kh&#225;n, who in the days of Sult&#225;n Muhammad the son of Sult&#225;n <corr sic="Fir&#250;z">F&#237;r&#250;z</corr>, king of Dehli, gained the independent rule of M&#225;lwa, built outside this fort an assembly mosque, which has in front of it fixed in the ground a four-cornered iron column about four feet round. When Sult&#225;n Bah&#225;dur of Gujar&#225;t took M&#225;lwa (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1530&#8211;31) he wished to carry this column to Gujar&#225;t. In digging it up the pillar fell and broke in two, one piece measuring twenty-two feet the other thirteen feet. As it was lying here uncared-for<corr>,</corr> I (Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r) ordered the big piece to be carried to &#193;gra to be put up in the courtyard of the shrine of him whose abode is the heavenly throne (Akbar), to be utilised as a lamp post. The mosque has two gates. In <pb/>front of the arch of one gate they have fixed a stone tablet engraved with a prose passage to the effect that &#194;hm&#237;d Sh&#225;h Ghori in the year H. 808 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1405) laid the foundation of this mosque. On the other arch they have written a poetic inscription of which the following verses are a part:

In place of a moat it is surrounded by a deep chasm, so that it is impossible to use missiles against it. Within the fort water and provisions are abundant and it includes land enough to grow grain for the garrison. The extent of its walls makes it impossible for an army to invest it. Most of the villages near it are too small to furnish supplies to a besieging force. The south or T&#225;r&#225;p&#250;r gate is exceedingly difficult of access. A horseman can hardly approach it. From whichever side the fort may be attempted, most difficult heights have to be scaled.

Hoshang enriched his capital with buildings, among them the Great Mosque and his own tomb, both of which he left unfinished. Hoshang&#8217;s minister Malik Mugh&#237;s (who received the title of Ulugh A&#226;zam Hum&#225;y&#250;n Kh&#225;n) appears to have built the assembly mosque near the S&#225;gar Lake in Hoshang&#8217;s life-time, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1431. Another of his buildings must have been a mint, as copper coins remain bearing Hoshang&#8217;s name, and M&#225;ndu Sh&#225;di&#225;b&#225;d as the place of mintage.<note id="n359.5" n="5">It follows that Farishtah (Briggs, IV. 196) is mistaken in stating that Hoshang&#8217;s son Muhammad gave M&#225;ndu the name of Sh&#225;di&#225;b&#225;d, the Abode of Joy.</note> In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1432, at Hoshang&#225;b&#225;d, on the left bank of the Narbada, about 120 miles east of M&#225;ndu, Hoshang, who was suffering from diabetes, took greatly to heart the fall of a ruby out of his crown. He said: A few days before the death of F&#237;r&#250;z Tughlak a jewel dropped from his crown. Hoshang ordered that he should be taken to M&#225;ndu. Before he had gone many miles the king died. His nobles carried the body to the Madrasah or college in Sh&#225;di&#225;b&#225;d or M&#225;ndu, and buried him in the college on the ninth day of Zil Hajjah, the twelfth month of <hi rend='sc'>a.h.</hi>&#160;838 = <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1434.

Mehm&#250;d Khilji then asked his father to accept the succession, but his father declined, saying that Mehm&#250;d was fitter to be king. In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1436 Mehm&#250;d was accordingly crowned with the royal tiara of Hoshang.<note id="n360.1" n="1">The following more detailed, but also more confused, story is told in the W&#225;ki&#259;t-i-Musht&#225;ki (Elliot, IV. 552&#8211;54): A man named Mehm&#250;d, son of Mugh&#237;s Khilji, came to Hoshang and entered his service. He was a treacherous man, who secretly aspired to the throne. He became minister, and gave his daughter in marriage to the king. [Farishtah, <abbr>Pers.</abbr> Text<corr>,</corr> II. 474, says: &#8220;Malik Mugh&#237;s gave his daughter (Mehm&#250;d&#8217;s sister) in marriage, not to Hoshang, but to Hoshang&#8217;s son Muhammad Shah.&#8221;] His father Malik Mugh&#237;s, coming to know of his son&#8217;s ambitious designs, informed the king of them. Hereupon Mehm&#250;d feigned illness, and to deceive the king&#8217;s physicians shut himself in a dark room and drank the blood of a newly killed goat. When the physicians came Mehm&#250;d rose hastily, threw up the blood into a basin, and tossing back his head rolled on the floor as if in pain. The physicians called for a light. When they saw that what Mehm&#250;d had spat up was blood they were satisfied of his sickness, and told the king that Mehm&#250;d had not long to live. The king refrained from killing a dying man. This strange story seems to be an embellishment of a passage in Farishtah (<abbr>Pers.</abbr> Text, II. 477). When Kh&#225;n Jeh&#225;n, that is Malik Mugh&#237;s the father of Mehm&#250;d, was ordered by Sult&#225;n Muhammad to take the field against the R&#225;jput rebels of N&#225;doti (H&#225;roti?) many of the old nobles of M&#225;lwa went with him. In their absence the party hostile to the Khiljis represented to Sult&#225;n Muhammad that Mehm&#250;d Khilji was plotting his death. On hearing that the Sult&#225;n was enraged against him Mehm&#250;d secluded himself from the Court on pretence of illness. At the same time he worked secretly and bribed Sult&#225;n Muhammad&#8217;s cup-bearer to poison his master. On the death of Sult&#225;n Muhammad the party of nobles opposed to Mehm&#250;d, concealing the fact of Muhammad&#8217;s death, sent word that Muhammad had ordered him immediately to the palace, as he wanted to send him on an embassy to Gujar&#225;t. Mehm&#250;d, who knew that the Sult&#225;n was dead, returned word to the nobles that he had vowed a life-long seclusion as the sweeper of the shrine of his patron Sult&#225;n Hoshang, but that if the nobles came to him and convinced him that the good of his country depended on his going to Gujar&#225;t he was ready to go and see Sult&#225;n Muhammad. The nobles were caught in their own trap. They went to Mehm&#250;d and were secured and imprisoned by him.</note> He conferred on his father the honour of being attended by mace-bearers carrying gold and silver sticks, who, when the Kh&#225;n mounted or went out, had, like the mace-bearers of independent monarchs, the privilege of repeating the <hi>Bismillah</hi> &#8216;In the name of the compassionate and merciful All&#225;h.&#8217;<note id="n360.2" n="2">Farishtah, <abbr>Pers.</abbr> Text<corr>,</corr> II. 480.</note> He gave his father royal honours, the white canopy and the silver quiver, and to his title of Malik Ashraf Kh&#225;n Jeh&#225;n he added among others Am&#237;r-ul-Umara and A&#226;zam Hum&#225;y&#250;n.<note id="n360.3" n="3">Briggs&#8217; Farishtah, IV. 196.

 </p><p>Of the surprising size and fantastic arrangements of Ghi&#225;s-ud-d&#237;n&#8217;s pleasure city, the true M&#225;ndu Sh&#225;di&#225;b&#225;d or Abode of Joy, curious details have been preserved. This Abode of Pleasure was a city not a palace. It contained 15,000 inhabitants, all of them women, none either old or plain-featured, and each trained to some profession or craft. Among them were the whole officers of a court, besides courtiers, teachers, musicians, dancers, prayer-readers, embroiderers, and followers of all crafts and callings. Whenever the king heard of a beautiful girl he never rested till he obtained her. This city of women had its two regiments of guards, the Archers and the Carabineers, each 500 strong, its soldiers dressed like men in a distinguishing uniform. The archers were beautiful young Turk&#237; damsels, all armed with bows and arrows: the carabineers were Abyssinian maidens, each carrying a carbine. Attached to the palace and city was a deer park, where the Lord of Leisure used to hunt with his favourites. Each dweller in the city of women received her daily dole of grain and coppers, and besides the women were many pensioners, mice<corr>,</corr> parrots and pigeons, who also received the same dole as their owners. So evenly just was Ghi&#225;s-ud-d&#237;n in the matter of his allowances, that the prettiest of his favourites received the same allowance as the roughest carabineer.<note id="n363.1" n="1">Farishtah <abbr>Pers.</abbr> Text, II. 504&#8211;505.</note>

 </p><p>The Lord of the City of Pleasure was deeply religious. Whenever he was amusing himself two of his companions held in front of him a cloth to remind him of his shroud. A thousand <hi>H&#225;fizahs</hi>, that is women who knew the Kur&#226;&#225;n by heart, constantly repeated its holy verses, and, under the orders of the king, whenever he changed his raiment the <hi>H&#225;fizahs</hi> blew on his body from head to foot with their prayer-hallowed breath.<note id="n363.2" n="2">Farishtah <abbr>Pers.</abbr> Text, II. 505.</note> None of the five daily prayers passed unprayed. If at any of the hours of prayer the king was asleep he was sprinkled with water, and when water failed to arouse him, he was dragged out of bed. Even when dragged out of bed by his servants the king never <corr sic="uttured">uttered</corr> an improper or querulous word.

 </p><p>So keen was his sense of justice that when one of his courtiers pretending he had purchased her, brought to him a maiden of ideal beauty, and her relations, not knowing she had been given to the king, came to complain, though they gladly resigned her, the king grieved over his unconscious wrong.

 </p><p>The king&#8217;s spirit of peace steeped the land, which, like its ruler, after thirty years of fighting yearned for rest. For fourteen years neither inward malcontent nor foreign foe broke the quiet. In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1482 Bahlol Lodi advanced from Dehli to subdue M&#225;lwa. The talk of M&#225;ndu was Bahlol&#8217;s approach, but no whisper of it passed into the charmed City of Women. At last the son-minister forced his way into the king&#8217;s presence. At the news of pressing danger his soldier-spirit awoke in Ghi&#225;s-ud-d&#237;n. His orders for meeting the invaders were so prompt and well-planned that the king of Dehli paid a ransom and withdrew. A second rest of fifteen years ended in the son-minister once more forcing his way into the Presence. In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1500 the son presented his father, now an aged man of eighty, with a cup of sherbet and told him to drink. The king, whose armlet of bezoar stone had already twice made poison harmless, drew the stone from his arm. He thanked the Almighty for granting him, unworthy, the happiest life that had ever fallen to the lot of man. He prayed that the sin of his death might not be laid to his son&#8217;s charge, drank the poison, and died.<note id="n364.2" n="2">Briggs&#8217; Farishtah, IV. 236&#8211;239; W&#225;ki&#259;t-i-Jeh&#225;ng&#237;ri in Elliot, VI. 349&#8211;350; W&#225;ki&#259;t-i-Musht&#225;ki in Elliot, IV. 554&#8211;55; Malcolm&#8217;s Central India, I. 35&#8211;36. The Mir&#259;t-i-Sikandari (<abbr>Pers.</abbr> Text, 160) has the following notice of Ghi&#225;s-ud-d&#237;n: The Sult&#225;ns of M&#225;ndu had reached such a pitch of luxury and ease that it is impossible to imagine aught exceeding it. Among them Sult&#225;n Ghi&#225;s-ud-d&#237;n was so famous for his luxurious habits, that at present (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1611) if any one exceeds in luxury and pleasure, they say he is a second Ghi&#225;s-ud-d&#237;n. The orders of the Sult&#225;n were that no event of a painful nature or one in which there was any touch of sadness should be related to him. They say that during his entire reign news of a sad nature was only twice conveyed to him: once when his son-in-law died and once when his daughter was brought before him clothed in white. On this occasion the Sult&#225;n is related to have simply said: &#8220;Perhaps her husband is dead.&#8221; This he said because the custom of the people of India is that when the husband of a woman dies she gives up wearing coloured clothes. The second occasion was when the army of Sult&#225;n Bahlol Lodi plundered several of the districts of Chanderi. Though it was necessary to report this to the Sult&#225;n, his ministers were unable to communicate it to him. They therefore asked a band of actors (<hi>bh&#225;nds</hi>) to assume the dress of Afgh&#225;ns, and mentioning the districts to represent them as being pillaged and laid waste. Sult&#225;n Ghi&#225;s-ud-d&#237;n exclaimed in surprise: &#8220;But is the governor of Chanderi dead that he does not avenge upon the Afgh&#225;ns the ruin of his country!&#8221;</note>

 </p><p>Ghi&#225;s-ud-d&#237;n can hardly have shut himself off so completely from state affairs as the story-tellers make out.

According to Farishtah (<abbr>Pers.</abbr> Text, II. 538&#8211;39) in 1562, when B&#225;z Bah&#225;dur went out to meet Akbar&#8217;s general, Adham Kh&#225;n Atkah, he placed R&#250;p Mati and his other singers in S&#225;rangp&#250;r under a party of his men with orders to kill the women in case of a reverse. On hearing of B&#225;z Bah&#225;dur&#8217;s defeat the soldiers hastily sabred as many of the women as they could and fled. Among the women left for dead was R&#250;p Mati, who, though dangerously wounded, was not killed. When Adham Atkah entered S&#225;rangp&#250;r his first care was to enquire what had become of R&#250;p Mati. On hearing of her condition he had her wound attended to by the best surgeons, promising her, as a help to her cure, a speedy union with her beloved. On her recovery R&#250;p Mati claimed the general&#8217;s promise. He prevaricated and pressed his own suit. R&#250;p Mati temporised. One night the impatient Turk sent her a message asking her to come to him. R&#250;p Mati to gain time invited him to her own pavilion which she said was specially adorned to be the abode of love. Next night the Atkah went to her house in disguise. Her women directed him to R&#250;p Mati&#8217;s couch. Adham found her robed and garlanded, but cold in death.

He notices that besides in the centre of the hill where stands an eight-storeyed minaret, the city had many monuments of ancient magnificence, among them the tombs of the Khilji Sult&#225;ns. And that from the dome which is over the sepulchre of Sult&#225;n Mehm&#250;d, the son of Hoshang (this should be the sepulchre of Hoshang built by his successor Sult&#225;n Mehm&#250;d) water drops in the height of summer to the astonishment of the ignorant. But, he adds, men of understanding know how to account for the water-drops.<note id="n371.5" n="5">Gladwin&#8217;s &#193;in-i-Akbari, II. 41.</note> Abul Fazl further notices that on M&#225;ndu Hill is found a species of tamarind whose fruit is as big as the cocoanut, the pulp of <pb id="pb372" n="372"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix II.</item><item>The Hill Fort of M&#225;ndu.</item><item><hi><hi rend="sc">History</hi></hi></item><item>The Mughals, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1570&#8211;1720.</item></list> </fw>which is very white. This is the African baobab or <foreign lang="la-x-bio" xml:lang="la-x-bio">Adansonia digitata</foreign>, known in Hindust&#225;ni as <hi>goramli</hi> or white tamarind, whose great fruit is about the size of a cocoanut. Its monster baobabs are still a feature of M&#225;ndu. Some among them look old enough to have been yielding fruit 300 years ago. Finally Abul Fazl refers to M&#225;ndu as one of twenty-eight towns where Akbar&#8217;s copper coins were struck.<note id="n372.1" n="1">Blochman&#8217;s <corr sic="&#193;&#237;n-i-Akbari">&#193;in-i-Akbari</corr>, 31.</note> About twenty years later (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1610) the historian Farishtah<note id="n372.2" n="2">Briggs&#8217; Farishtah, IV. 169, 181, 190.</note> thus describes the hill. The fort of M&#225;ndu is a work of solid masonry deemed to be one of the strongest fortifications in that part of the world. It is built on an insulated mountain thirty-eight miles in circumference.<note id="n372.3" n="3">Nineteen <hi>kos</hi>, taking the <hi>kos</hi> to be two miles.</note> The place of a ditch round the fortification is supplied by a natural ravine so deep that it seems impossible to take the fort by regular approaches. Within the fort is abundance of water and forage, but the area is not large enough to grow a sufficient store of grain. The hill cannot be invested. The easiest access is from the north by the Dehli Gate. The south road with an entrance by the T&#225;r&#225;p&#250;r Gate is so steep that cavalry can with difficulty be led up. Like Abul Fazl Farishtah notices that, except during the rains, water constantly oozes from between the chinks in the masonry of the dome of Sult&#225;n Hoshang&#8217;s tomb. He says the natives of India attribute this dropping to universal veneration for Sult&#225;n Hoshang, for whose death, they say, the very stones shed tears.

 </p><p>Except that copper coins continued to be minted and that it was nominally one of the four capitals of the empire, during the emperor Akbar&#8217;s reign M&#225;ndu was practically deserted. The only traces of Akbar&#8217;s presence on the hill are in two of the five inscriptions already quoted from the N&#237;lkanth pleasure-house, dated <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1591 and <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1600.

 </p><p>After about fifty years of almost complete neglect the emperor Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r, during a few months in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1617, enabled M&#225;ndu once more to justify its title of Sh&#225;di&#225;b&#225;d, the Abode of Joy. Early in March <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1617, in the eleventh year of his reign, the emperor Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r after spending four months in travelling the 189 miles from Ajm&#237;r by way of Ujjain, arrived at <corr sic="N&#226;alchah">Na&#226;lchah</corr> on the main land close to the north of M&#225;ndu. The emperor notices that most of the forty-six marches into which the 189 miles were divided ended on the bank of some lake stream or great river in green grass and woody landscape, brightened by poppy fields. We came, he writes, enjoying the beauty of the country and shooting, never weary, as if we were moving from one garden to another.

 </p><p>Of the country round Na&#226;lchah Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r says:<note id="n372.4" n="4">The emperor <corr sic="Jeh&#225;ngir&#8217;s">Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r&#8217;s</corr> Memoirs, <abbr>Pers.</abbr> Text, Sir Sayad &#193;hmed&#8217;s Edition, 178&#8211;203.</note> What can be written worthy of the beauty and the pleasantness of Na&#226;lchah. The neighbourhood is full of mango trees. The whole country is one unbroken and restful evergreen. Owing to its beauty I remained there three days. I granted the place to Kam&#225;l Kh&#225;n, taking it from Keshava M&#225;r&#250;, and I changed its name to Kam&#225;lp&#250;r. I had frequent meetings with some of the wise men of the <hi>jogis</hi>, many of whom had assembled here. Na&#226;lchah is one of the best places in M&#225;lwa. It has an extensive growth of vines, and among its mango groves and vineyards wander streamlets of water. I arrived at a time when, contrary to the northern climes, the vines were in blossom and fruit, and so great was the vintage that the meanest boor could eat grapes to his fill. The poppy was also in flower, and its fields delighted the eye with their many-coloured beauty.

About an hour (three <hi>ghadis</hi>) later I entered the quarters which had been prepared to receive me. During my passage across the hill-top I scattered <abbr>Rs.</abbr> 1500. Before my arrival Abdul Kar&#237;m the engineer had been sent by me to repair the buildings of the former kings of M&#225;ndu. While my fortunate standards were at Ajm&#237;r Abdul Kar&#237;m repaired such of the old M&#225;ndu buildings as were fit to be repaired and built others anew. On the whole he had provided quarters for me, the like of which have probably never been built in any other place. Three <hi>l&#225;khs</hi> of rupees were spent on these repairs and buildings. I wish it had been possible to construct buildings like these in all cities likely to be visited by royalty. This fortress, he continues, stands on the top of a hill about thirty-six miles (18 <hi>kos</hi>) in circumference. They say that before the days of R&#225;ja Bikram&#225;jit a king was reigning over these parts <corr sic="who">whose</corr> name was Jaisingh Deva. In his time a man went to the forest to cut grass. When he brought the grass back he found that the blade of his sickle had turned yellow. The grasscutter in his surprise went to M&#225;ndan, an ironsmith. M&#225;ndan knew that the sickle was gold. He had heard that in those parts was to be found the philosopher&#8217;s stone, whose touch turns iron and copper into gold. He told the grasscutter to lead him to the place where the sickle had turned yellow, and there he found the philosopher&#8217;s stone. The smith presented this treasure to his king. The king amassed untold wealth, part of which he spent in building M&#225;ndu fortress which he completed in twelve years. At the request of the smith on most of the stones in the walls a mark was cut in the form of an anvil. Towards the close of his life, when king Jaisingh Deva withdrew his heart from the world, he called many Br&#225;hmans together on the bank of the Narbada close to M&#225;ndu. He gave each Br&#225;hman a share of his wealth. And to the Br&#225;hman in whom he had the greatest faith he gave the philosopher&#8217;s stone. Enraged at the gift of a paltry stone the Br&#225;hman threw it into the Narbada, and there the philosopher&#8217;s stone still lies. The emperor continues: On the 20th of <hi>Farward&#237;n</hi>, five weeks after my arrival (11th April 1617) in reward for his services in repairing the buildings of M&#225;ndu, I conferred on my engineer Abdul Kar&#237;m the command of 1200 horse, with the title of Ma&#225;m&#250;r Kh&#225;n.

 </p><p>M&#225;ndu had for the emperor the strong attraction of abundance of game. Among numerous entries of <hi>n&#237;lg&#225;i</hi> or blue-bull shooting the following occur: On the 4th of the first month of <hi>Farward&#237;n</hi> (16th) March the watchmen of the chase brought word that they had marked down a lion near the S&#225;gar Lake, which is a construction of the ancient rulers of M&#225;ndu. I mounted and proceeded towards the lake. When the lion broke cover he attacked and wounded ten or twelve of the <hi>Ah&#225;d&#237;s</hi><note id="n373.1" n="1">Literally single-men.

In the end I brought him down with three gun shots and saved God&#8217;s creatures from his evil. On the 22nd of the same month (April 3rd, 1617) the watchmen brought news of a tiger. I mounted forthwith and despatched him with three bullets. On the 7th of <hi>Ard&#237; Bihisht</hi> (April 18th, 1617) the watchmen brought word that they had marked down four tigers. At one in the afternoon I started for the <pb id="pb374" n="374"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix II.</item><item>The Hill Fort of M&#225;ndu.</item><item><hi><hi rend="sc">History</hi></hi></item><item>The Mughals, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1570&#8211;1720.</item></list> </fw>place with N&#250;r Jeh&#225;n Begam. N&#250;r Jeh&#225;n asked my leave to shoot the tigers with her gun. I said &#8220;Be it so.&#8221; In a trice she killed these four tigers with six bullets. I had never seen such shooting. To shoot from the back of an elephant from within a closed <hi>howdah</hi> and bring down with six bullets four wild beasts without giving them an opportunity of moving or springing is wonderful.

 </p><p>The rains set in with unusual severity. Rain fell for forty days continuously. With the rain were severe thunderstorms accompanied by lightning which injured some of the old buildings.<note id="n374.4" n="4">Tuzuk-i-Jeh&#225;ng&#237;ri <abbr>Pers.</abbr> Text, 189.</note> His account of the beauty of the hill in July, when clear sunshine followed the forty days of rain, is one of the pleasantest passages in Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r&#8217;s Memoirs: What words of mine can describe the beauty of the grass and of the wild flowers! They clothe each hill and dale, each slope and plain. I know of no place so pleasant in climate and so pretty in scenery as M&#225;ndu in the rainy season. This month of July which is one of the months of the hot season, the sun being in Leo, one cannot sleep within the house without a coverlet, and during the day there is no need for a fan. What I have noticed is but a small part of the many beauties of M&#225;ndu. Two things I have seen here which I had seen nowhere in India. One of them is the tree of the wild plantain which grows all over the hill top, the other is the nest of the <hi>mamolah</hi> or wagtail. Till now no bird-catcher could tell its nest. It so happened that in the building where I lodged we found a wagtail&#8217;s nest with two young ones.

 </p><p>The beautiful surroundings of the S&#225;gar lake offered to the elegant taste of N&#250;r Jeh&#225;n a fitting opportunity for honouring the Shab-i-Bar&#225;t or Night of Jubilee with special illuminations. The emperor describes the result in these words: On the evening of Thursday the 19th of <hi>Amard&#225;d</hi>, the fifth month of the Persian year (early July, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1617), I went with the ladies of the palace to see the buildings and palaces on the S&#225;gar lake which were built by the old kings of M&#225;ndu. The 26th of <hi>Amard&#225;d</hi> (about mid-July) was the Shab-i-Bar&#225;t holiday. I ordered a jubilee or assembly of joy to be held on the occasion in one of the palaces occupied by N&#250;r Jeh&#225;n Begam in the midst of the big lake. The nobles and others were invited to attend this party which was organized by the Begam, and I ordered the cup and other intoxicants with various fruits and minced meats to be given to all who wished them. It was a wonderful gathering. As evening set in the lanterns and lamps gleaming along the banks of the lake made an illumination such as never had been seen. The countless lights with which the palaces and buildings were ablaze shining on the lake made the whole surface of the water appear to be on fire.<note id="n375.3" n="3">Tuzuk-i-Jeh&#225;ng&#237;ri <abbr>Pers.</abbr> Text, 190.</note>

I found &#193;saf Kh&#225;n lodged in a glen of great beauty surrounded by other little vales and dells with waterfalls and running streamlets and green and shady mango groves. In one of these dells were from two to three hundred sweet pandanus or <hi>kewda</hi> trees.

He had been absent fifteen months and eleven days. After he had performed the ceremonies of kissing the ground and the <hi>kurnish</hi> or prostration, I called him up to my bay window or <hi>jharokah</hi>.

He also gave me a case full of the rarest precious stones. I ordered the military paymasters to make presents to his nobles according to their rank. The first to come was Kh&#225;n Jeh&#225;n, whom I allowed the honour of kissing my feet. For his victory over the R&#225;na of Chitor I had before granted to my fortunate child Kurram the rank of a commander of 20,000 with 10,000 horse. Now for his service in the Dakhan I made him a commander of 30,000 and 20,000 horse with the title of Sh&#225;h Jeh&#225;n. I also ordered that henceforward he should enjoy the privilege of sitting on a stool near my throne, an honour which did not exist and is the first of its kind granted to anyone in my family. I further granted him a special dress. To do him honour I came down from the window and with my own hand scattered over his head as sacrifice a trayfull of precious stones as well as a large trayfull of gold.

 </p><p>Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r&#8217;s last M&#225;ndu entry is this: On the night of Friday in the month of <hi>Ab&#225;n</hi> (October 24th, 1617) in all happiness and good fortune I marched from M&#225;ndu and halted on the bank of the lake at Na&#226;lchah.

 </p><p>Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r&#8217;s stay at M&#225;ndu is referred to by more than one English traveller. In March 1617, the Rev. Edward Terry, chaplain to the Right Honourable Sir T. Roe Lord Ambassador to the Great Mughal, came to M&#225;ndu from <corr sic="Burh&#225;np&#250;r">Burh&#225;npur</corr> in east Kh&#225;ndesh.<note id="n376.1" n="1">A Voyage to East India, 181. Terry gives April 1616, but Roe seems correct in saying March 1617. Compare W&#225;ki&#259;t-i-Jeh&#225;ng&#237;ri in Elliot, VI. 351.</note> Terry crossed a broad river, the Narbada, at a great town called Anchabarpur (Akbarpur)<note id="n376.2" n="2">Akbarpur lies between Dharampuri and Waisar. Malcolm&#8217;s Central India, I. 84 note.</note> in the N&#237;m&#225;r plain not far south of M&#225;ndu hill. The way up, probably by the Bhairav pass a few miles east of M&#225;ndu, seemed to Terry exceeding long. The ascent was very difficult, taking the carriages, apparently meaning coaches and wagons, two whole days.<note id="n376.3" n="3">Carriages may have the old meaning of things carried, that is baggage. The time taken favours the view that wagons or carts were forced up the hill. For the early seventeenth century use of carriages in its modern sense compare Terry (Voyage, 161). Of our wagons drawn with oxen ... and other carriages we made a ring every night; also Dodsworth (1614), who describes a band of <corr sic="R&#225;jp&#250;ts">R&#225;jputs</corr> near Baroda cutting off two of his carriages (Kerr&#8217;s Voyages, IX. 203); and Roe (1616), who journeyed from Ajm&#237;r to M&#225;ndu with twenty camels four carts and two coaches (Kerr, IX. 308). Terry&#8217;s carriages seem to be Roe&#8217;s coaches, to which Dela Valle (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1623) <corr sic="Haklyt&#8217;s">Hakluyt&#8217;s</corr> Edition, <corr>(</corr>I. 21) refers as much like the Indian chariots described by Strabo (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;50) covered with crimson silk fringed with yellow about the roof and the curtains. Compare Idr&#237;si (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1100&#8211;1150), but probably from Al Istakhiri, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;960: Elliot, I. 87). In all Nahrwala or north Gujar&#225;t the only mode of carrying either passengers or goods is in chariots drawn by oxen with harness and traces under the control of a driver. When in 1616 Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r left Ajm&#237;r for M&#225;ndu the English carriage presented to him by the English ambassador Sir Thomas Roe was allotted to the Sult&#225;nah N&#250;r Jeh&#225;n Begam. It was driven by an English coachman. Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r followed in the coach his own men had made in imitation of the English coach. Corryat (1615, Crudities III., Letters from India, unpaged) calls the English chariot a gallant coach of 150 pounds price.</note> Terry found the hill of M&#225;ndu stuck round with fair trees that kept their distance so, one from and below the other, that there was much delight in beholding them from either the bottom or the top of the hill. From one side only was the ascent not very high and steep. The top was flat plain and spacious with vast and <pb id="pb377" n="377"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix II.</item><item>The Hill Fort of M&#225;ndu.</item><item><hi><hi rend="sc">History</hi></hi></item><item>The Mughals, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1570&#8211;1720.</item></list> </fw>far-stretching woods in which were lions tigers and other beasts of prey and many wild elephants. Terry passed through M&#225;ndu a few days&#8217; march across a plain and level country, apparently towards Dh&#225;r, where he met the Lord Ambassador Sir Thomas Roe, who had summoned Terry from Surat to be his chaplain. Sir Thomas Roe was then marching from Ajm&#237;r to M&#225;ndu with the Court of the emperor Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r, whom Terry calls the Great King.

 </p><p>On the 3rd of March, says Roe, the Mughal was to have entered M&#225;ndu. But all had to wait for the good hour fixed by the astrologers. From the 6th of March, when he entered M&#225;ndu, till the 24th of October, the emperor Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r, with Sir Thomas Roe in attendance, remained at M&#225;ndu.<note id="n377.1" n="1">Kerr&#8217;s Voyages, IX. 335; <corr sic="W&#225;k&#236;&#259;t-i-Jeh&#225;ng&#237;ri">W&#225;ki&#259;t-i-Jeh&#225;ng&#237;ri</corr> in Elliot, VI. 377.</note> According to Roe before the Mughal visited M&#225;ndu the hill was not much inhabited, having more ruins by far than standing houses.<note id="n377.2" n="2">Roe writing from Ajm&#237;r in the previous year (29th August 1616) describes M&#225;ndu as a castle on a hill, where there is no town and no buildings. Kerr, IX. 267.</note> But the moving city that accompanied the emperor soon overflowed the hill-top. According to Roe Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r&#8217;s own encampment was walled round half a mile in circuit in the form of a fortress, with high screens or curtains of coarse stuff, somewhat like Aras hangings, red on the outside, the inside divided into compartments with a variety of figures. This enclosure had a handsome gateway and the circuit was formed into various coins and bulwarks. The posts that supported the curtains were all surmounted with brass tops.<note id="n377.3" n="3">Roe in Kerr&#8217;s Travels, IX. 313.</note> Besides the emperor&#8217;s encampment were the noblemen&#8217;s quarters, each at an appointed distance from the king&#8217;s tents, very handsome, some having their tents green, others white, others of mixed colours. The whole composed the most curious and magnificent sight Roe had ever beheld.<note id="n377.4" n="4">Roe in Kerr&#8217;s Travels, IX. 314.</note> The hour taken by Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r in passing from the Dehli Gate to his own quarters, the two English miles from Roe&#8217;s lodge which was not far from the Dehli Gate to Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r&#8217;s palace, and other reasons noted below make it almost certain that the Mughal&#8217;s encampment and the camps of the leading nobles were on the open slopes to the south of the Sea Lake between B&#225;z Bah&#225;dur&#8217;s palace on the east and Songad on the west. And that the palace at M&#225;ndu from which Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r wrote was the building now known as B&#225;z Bah&#225;dur&#8217;s palace.<note id="n377.5" n="5">Compare W&#225;ki&#259;t-i-Jeh&#225;ng&#237;ri in Elliot, VI. 377.</note> A few months before it reached M&#225;ndu the imperial camp had turned the whole valley of Ajm&#237;r into a magnificent city,<note id="n377.6" n="6">Roe in Kerr&#8217;s Travels, IX. 314.</note> and a few weeks before reaching M&#225;ndu at Thoda, about fifty miles south-east of Ajm&#237;r, the camp formed a settlement not less in circuit than twenty English miles, equalling in size almost any town in Europe.<note id="n377.7" n="7">Roe in Kerr&#8217;s Travels, IX. 321.</note> In the middle of the encampment were all sorts of shops so regularly disposed that all persons knew where to go for everything.

 </p><p>The demands of so great a city overtaxed the powers of the deserted M&#225;ndu. The scarcity of water soon became so pressing that the poor were commanded to leave and all horses and cattle were ordered off the hill.<note id="n377.8" n="8">Roe in Kerr&#8217;s Travels, IX. 335.</note> Of the scarcity of water the English traveller Corryat, who was then a guest of Sir Thomas Roe, writes: On the first day one of my Lord&#8217;s people, Master Herbert, brother to Sir Edward Herbert, found a fountain which, if he had not done, he would have had to send ten course <pb id="pb378" n="378"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix II.</item><item>The Hill Fort of M&#225;ndu.</item><item><hi><hi rend="sc">History</hi></hi></item><item>The Mughals, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1570&#8211;1720.</item></list> </fw>(<hi>kos</hi>) every day for water to a river called Narbada that falleth into the Bay of Cambye near Broach. The custom being such that whatsoever fountain or tank is found by any great man in time of drought he shall keep it proper to his without interruption. The day after one of the king&#8217;s Hadis (<hi>Ah&#225;dis</hi>) finding the same and striving for it was taken by my Lord&#8217;s people and bound.<note id="n378.1" n="1">Corryat&#8217;s Crudities, III. Extracts (unpaged). This Master Herbert was Thomas, brother of Sir Edward Herbert, the first Lord Herbert. It seems probable that this Thomas supplied his cousin Sir Thomas Herbert who was travelling in India and Persia in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1627 with his account of M&#225;ndu. See below pages 381&#8211;382.</note> Corryat adds: During the time of the great drought two Moor nobles daily sent ten camels to the Narbada and distributed the water to the poor, which was so dear they sold a little skin for 8 pies (one penny).<note id="n378.2" n="2">Corryat&#8217;s Crudities, III. Extracts (unpaged).</note>

 </p><p>Terry notices that among the piles of buildings that held their heads above ruin were not a few unfrequented mosques or Muhammadan churches. Though the people who attended the king were marvellously straitened for room to put their most excellent horses, none would use the churches as stables, even though they were forsaken and out of use. This abstinence seems to have been voluntary, as Roe&#8217;s servants, who were sent in advance, took possession of a fair court with walled enclosure in which was a goodly temple and a tomb. It was the best in the whole circuit of M&#225;ndu, the only drawback being that it was two miles from the king&#8217;s house.<note id="n378.3" n="3">Terry&#8217;s Voyage, 183; Roe in Kerr, IX. 335.</note> The air was wholesome and the prospect was pleasant, as it was on the edge of the hill.<note id="n378.4" n="4">Roe in Kerr, IX. 335.</note> The emperor, perhaps referring rather to the south of the hill, which from the elaborate building and repairs carried out in advance by Abdul Kar&#237;m seems to have been called the New City, gives a less deserted impression of M&#225;ndu. He writes (24th March 1617): Many buildings and relics of the old kings are still standing, for as yet decay has not fallen upon the city. On the 24th I rode to see the royal edifices. First I visited the J&#225;m&#225; Masjid built by Sult&#225;n Hoshang Ghori. It is a very lofty building and erected entirely of hewn stone. Although it has been standing 180 years it looks as if built to-day. Then I visited the sepulchres of the kings and rulers of the Khilji dynasty, among which is the sepulchre of the eternally cursed N&#225;sir-ud-d&#237;n.<note id="n378.5" n="5"><corr sic="W&#225;ki&#259;t-i-Jeh&#225;ngiri">W&#225;ki&#259;t-i-Jeh&#225;ng&#237;ri</corr> in Elliot, VI. 349.</note> Sher Sh&#225;h to show his horror of N&#225;sir-ud-d&#237;n, the father-slayer, ordered his people to beat N&#225;sir-ud-d&#237;n&#8217;s tomb with sticks. Jeh&#225;ngir also kicked the grave. Then he ordered the tomb to be opened and the remains to be taken out and burnt. Finally, fearing the remains might pollute the eternal light, he ordered the ashes to be thrown into the Narbada.<note id="n378.6" n="6">W&#225;ki&#259;t-i-Jeh&#225;ngiri in Elliot, VI. 350.</note>

 </p><p>The pleasant outlying position of Roe&#8217;s lodge proved to be open to the objection that out of the vast wilderness wild beasts often came, seldom returning without a sheep, a goat, or a kid. One evening a great lion leapt over the stone wall that encompassed the yard and <corr sic="snapt">snapped</corr> up the Lord Ambassador&#8217;s little white neat shock, that is as Roe explains a small Irish mastiff, which ran out barking at the lion. Out of the ruins of the mosque and tomb Roe built a lodge,<note id="n378.7" n="7">Terry&#8217;s Voyage, 228.</note> and here he passed the rains with his &#8220;family,&#8221; including besides his secretary, chaplain, and cook twenty-three Englishmen and about sixty native servants, and during part of the time the sturdy half-crazed traveller Tom Coryate or Corryat.<note id="n378.8" n="8">Terry&#8217;s Voyage, 69.</note> They had <pb id="pb379" n="379"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix II.</item><item>The Hill Fort of M&#225;ndu.</item><item><hi><hi rend="sc">History</hi></hi></item><item>The Mughals, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1570&#8211;1720.</item></list> </fw>their flock of sheep and goats, all necessaries belonging to the kitchen and everything else required for bodily use including bedding and all things pertaining thereto.<note id="n379.1" n="1">Terry&#8217;s Voyage, 183.</note> Among the necessaries were tables<note id="n379.2" n="2">Terry&#8217;s Voyage, 186, 198.</note> and chairs, since the Ambassador refused to adopt the Mughal practice of sitting cross-legged on mats &#8220;like taylors on their shopboards.&#8221; Roe&#8217;s diet was dressed by an English and an Indian cook and was served on plate by waiters in red taffata cloaks guarded with green taffata. The chaplain wore a long black cassock, and the Lord Ambassador wore English habits made as light and cool as possible.<note id="n379.3" n="3">Terry&#8217;s Voyage, 198, 205.</note>

 </p><p>On the 12th of March, a few days after they were settled at M&#225;ndu, came the festival of the Persian New Year. Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r held a great reception seated on a throne of gold bespangled with rubies emeralds and turquoises. The hall was adorned with pictures of the King and Queen of England, the Princess Elizabeth, Sir Thomas Smith and others, with beautiful Persian hangings. On one side, on a little stage, was a couple of women singers. The king commanded that Sir T. Roe should come up and stand beside him on the steps of the throne where stood on one side the Persian Ambassador and on the other the old king of Kandah&#225;r with whom Sir T. Roe ranked. The king called the Persian Ambassador and gave him some stones and a young elephant. The Ambassador knelt and knocked his head against the steps of the throne to thank him.<note id="n379.4" n="4">Roe in Kerr&#8217;s Voyages, IX. 337; Pinkerton&#8217;s Voyages, VIII. 35.</note> From time to time during Terry&#8217;s stay at M&#225;ndu, the Mughal, with his stout daring Persian and Tartarian horsemen and some grandees, went out to take young wild elephants in the great woods that environed M&#225;ndu. The elephants were caught in strong toils prepared for the purpose and were manned and made fit for service. In these hunts the king and his men also pursued lions and other wild beasts on horseback, killing some of them with their bows carbines and lances.<note id="n379.5" n="5">Terry&#8217;s Voyage, 403.</note>

 </p><p>The first of September was Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r&#8217;s birthday. The king, says Corryat,<note id="n379.6" n="6">Corryat&#8217;s Crudities, III. Letter 2. Extracts unpaged.</note> was forty-five years old, of middle height, corpulent, of a seemly composition of body, and of an olive coloured skin. Roe went to pay his respects and was conducted apparently to B&#225;z Bah&#225;dur&#8217;s Gardens to the east of the Rewa Pool. This tangled orchard was then a beautiful garden with a great square pond or tank set all round with trees and flowers and in the middle of the garden a pavilion or pleasure-house under which hung the scales in which the king was to be weighed.<note id="n379.7" n="7">Roe in Kerr&#8217;s Voyages, IX. 343.</note> The scales were of beaten gold set with many small stones as rubies and turquoises. They were hung by chains of gold, large and massive, but strengthened by silken ropes. The beam and tressels from which the scales hung were covered with thin plates of gold. All round were the nobles of the court seated on rich carpets waiting for the king. He came laden with diamonds rubies pearls and other precious vanities, making a great and glorious show. His swords targets and throne were corresponding in riches and splendour. His head neck breast and arms above the elbows and at the wrist were decked with chains of precious stones, and every finger had two or three rich rings. His legs were as it were fettered with chains of diamonds and rubies as large as walnuts and amazing pearls. He got into the scales crouching or sitting on his legs like a woman. To counterpoise his weight bags said to contain <abbr>Rs.</abbr> 9000 in <pb id="pb380" n="380"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix II.</item><item>The Hill Fort of M&#225;ndu.</item><item><hi><hi rend="sc">History</hi></hi></item><item>The Mughals, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1570&#8211;1720.</item></list> </fw>silver were changed six times. After this he was weighed against bags containing gold jewels and precious stones. Then against cloth of gold, silk stuffs, cotton goods, spices, and all commodities. Last of all against meal, butter, and corn. Except the silver, which was reserved for the poor, all was said to be distributed to Baniahs (that is Br&#225;hmans).<note id="n380.1" n="1">Roe in Kerr&#8217;s Travels, IX. 340&#8211;343.</note> After he was weighed Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r ascended the throne and had basons of nuts almonds and spices of all sorts given him. These the king threw about, and his great men scrambled prostrate on their bellies. Roe thought it not decent that he should scramble. And the king seeing that he stood aloof reached him a bason almost full and poured the contents into his cloak.<note id="n380.2" n="2">Roe in Kerr&#8217;s Travels, IX. 344.</note> Terry adds: The physicians noted the king&#8217;s weight and spoke flatteringly of it. Then the Mughal drank to his nobles in his royal wine and the nobles pledged his health, The king drank also to the Lord Ambassador, whom he always treated with special consideration, and presented him with the cup of gold curiously enamelled and crusted with rubies turkesses and emeralds.<note id="n380.3" n="3">Terry&#8217;s Voyage, 377. Terry&#8217;s details seem not to agree with Roe&#8217;s who states (Kerr&#8217;s Voyages, IX. 344 and Pinkerton&#8217;s Voyages, VIII. 37): I was invited to the drinking, but desired to be excused because there was no avoiding drinking, and their liquors are so hot that they burn out a man&#8217;s very bowels. Perhaps the invitation Roe declined was to a private drinking party after the public weighing was over.</note>

 </p><p>Of prince Khurram&#8217;s visit Roe writes: A month later (October 2nd) the proud prince Khurram, afterwards the emperor Sh&#225;h Jeh&#225;n (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1626&#8211;1657), returned from his glorious success in the Dakhan, accompanied by all the great men, in wondrous triumph.<note id="n380.4" n="4">Roe in Kerr&#8217;s Voyage, IX. 347; Elphinstone&#8217;s History, 494. Kerr (IX. 347) gives September 2 but October 2 is right. Compare Pinkerton&#8217;s Voyages, VIII. 39.</note> A week later (October 9th), hearing that the emperor was to pass near his lodging on his way to take the air at the Narbada, in accordance with the rule that the masters of all houses near which the king passes must make him a present, Roe took horse to meet the king. He offered the king an Atlas neatly bound, saying he presented the king with the whole world. The king was pleased. In return he praised Roe&#8217;s lodge, which he had built out of the ruins of the temple and the ancient tomb, and which was one of the best lodges in the camp.<note id="n380.5" n="5">Ruins of M&#225;ndu, 57. As the emperor must have passed out by the Dehli Gate, and as Roe&#8217;s lodge was two miles from B&#225;z Bah&#225;dur&#8217;s palace, the lodge cannot have been far from the Dehli Gate. It is disappointing that, of his many genial gossipy entries Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r does not devote one to Roe. The only reference to Roe&#8217;s visit is the indirect entry (Wa&#8217;ki&#259;t-i-Jeh&#225;ng&#237;ri in Elliot, VI. 347) that Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r gave one of his nobles a coach, apparently a copy of the English coach, with which, to Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r&#8217;s delight, Roe had presented him.</note> Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r left M&#225;ndu on the 24th October. On the 30th when Roe started the hill was entirely deserted.<note id="n380.6" n="6">Roe in Kerr&#8217;s Voyages, IX. 353.</note>

 </p><p>Terry mentions only two buildings at M&#225;ndu. One was the house of the Mughal, apparently B&#225;z Bah&#225;dur&#8217;s palace, which he describes as large and stately, built of excellent stone, well squared and put together, taking up a large compass of ground. He adds: We could never see how it was contrived within, as the king&#8217;s wives and women were there.<note id="n380.7" n="7">Terry&#8217;s Voyage, 180.</note> The only other building to which Terry refers, he calls &#8220;The Grot.&#8221; Of the grot, which is almost certainly the pleasure-house N&#237;lkanth, whose Persian inscriptions have been quoted above, Terry gives the following details: To the Mughal&#8217;s house, at a small distance from it, belonged a very curious grot. In the building of the grot a way was made into a <pb id="pb381" n="381"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix II.</item><item>The Hill Fort of M&#225;ndu.</item><item><hi><hi rend="sc">History</hi></hi></item><item>The Mughals, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1570&#8211;1720.</item></list> </fw>firm rock which showed itself on the side of the hill canopied over with part of that rock. It was a place that had much beauty in it by reason of the curious workmanship bestowed on it and much pleasure by reason of its coolness.<note id="n381.1" n="1">Terry&#8217;s Voyage, 181.</note> Besides the fountain this grot has still one of the charmingly cool and murmuring scallopped rillstones where, as Terry says, water runs down a broad stone table with many hollows like to scallop shells, in its passage over the hollows making so pretty a murmur as helps to tie the senses with the bonds of sleep.

Herbert, who was in Gujar&#225;t in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1626, says M&#225;ndu is seated at the side of a declining hill (apparently Herbert refers to the slope from the southern crest northwards to S&#225;gar Lake and the Grot or N&#237;lkanth) in which both for ornament and defence is a castle which is strong in being encompassed with a defensive wall of nearly five miles (probably <hi>kos</hi> that is ten miles): the whole, he adds, heretofore had fifteen miles circuit. But the city later built is of less time yet fresher beauty, whether you behold the temples (in one of which are entombed four kings), palaces or fortresses, especially that tower which is elevated 170 steps, supported by massive pillars and adorned with gates and windows very observable. It was built by Kh&#225;n Jeh&#225;n, who there lies buried. The confusedness of these details shows that Herbert obtained them second-hand, probably from Corryat&#8217;s Master Herbert on Sir T. Roe&#8217;s staff.<note id="n381.7" n="7">Herbert&#8217;s Travels, 84. Corryat&#8217;s Master Herbert was as already noticed named like the traveller Thomas. The two Thomases were distant relations, both being fourth in descent from Sir Richard Herbert of Colebroke, who lived about the middle of the fifteenth century. A further connection between the two families is the copy of complimentary verses &#8220;To my cousin Sir Thomas Herbert,&#8221; signed Ch. Herbert, in the 1634 and 1665 editions of Herbert&#8217;s Travels, which are naturally, though somewhat doubtfully, ascribed to Charles Herbert, a brother of our Master Thomas. It is therefore probable that after his return to England Sir Thomas Herbert obtained the M&#225;ndu details from Master Thomas who was himself a writer, the author of several poems and pamphlets. Corryat&#8217;s tale how, during the water-famine at M&#225;ndu, Master Herbert annexed a spring or cistern, and then bound a servant of the Great King who attempted to share in its use, shows admirable courage and resolution on the part of Master Thomas, then a youth of twenty years. The details of Thomas in his brother Lord Herbert&#8217;s autobiography give additional interest to the hero of Corryat&#8217;s tale of a Tank. Master Thomas was born in. <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1597. In 1610, when a page to Sir Edward Cecil and a boy of thirteen, in the German War especially in the siege of Juliers fifteen miles north-east of Aix-la-Chapelle, Master Thomas showed such forwardness as no man in that great army surpassed. On his voyage to India in 1617, in a fight with a great Portuguese carrack, <pb/>Captain Joseph, in command of Herbert&#8217;s ship <hi>Globe</hi>, was killed. Thomas took Joseph&#8217;s place, forced the carrack aground, and so riddled her with shot that she never floated again. To his brother&#8217;s visit to India Lord Herbert refers as a year spent with the merchants who went from Surat to the Great Mughal. After his return to England Master Thomas distinguished himself at Algiers, capturing a vessel worth &#163;1800. In 1622, when Master Thomas was in command of one of the ships sent to fetch Prince Charles (afterwards King Charles I.) from Spain, during the return voyage certain Low Countrymen and Dunkirkers, that is Dutch and Spanish vessels, offended the Prince&#8217;s dignity by fighting in his presence without his leave. The Prince ordered the fighting ships to be separated; whereupon Master Thomas, with some other ships got betwixt the fighters on either side, and shot so long that both Low Countrymen and Dunkirkers were glad to desist. Afterwards at divers times Thomas fought with great courage and success with divers men in single fight, sometimes hurting and disarming his adversary, sometimes driving him away. The end of Master Thomas was sad. Finding his proofs of himself undervalued he retired into a private and melancholy life, and after living in this sullen humour for many years, he died about 1642 and was buried in London in St. Martin&#8217;s near Charing Cross.</note> The new city of fresher <pb id="pb382" n="382"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix II.</item><item>The Hill Fort of M&#225;ndu.</item><item><hi><hi rend="sc">History</hi></hi></item><item>The Mughals, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1570&#8211;1720.</item></list> </fw>beauty is probably a reference to the buildings raised and repaired by Abdul Kar&#237;m against <corr sic="Jehang&#237;r&#8217;s">Jeh&#225;ng&#237;r&#8217;s</corr> coming, among which the chief seems to have been the palace now known by the name of B&#225;z Bah&#225;dur.

A ph&#230;ton can drive across the northern ravine-moat through the three gateways and along the hill-top, at least as far south as the Sea Lake. Large stretches of the level are cleared and tilled, and herds of cattle graze free from the dread of wild beasts.

 </p><p>This sketch notices only the main events and the main buildings. Even about the main buildings much is still doubtful.

They may bring to light traces of the M&#225;ndu kings and of the Mughal emperors, whose connection with M&#225;ndu, so far as the buildings are concerned, is still a blank. The ruins are so many and so widespread that weeks are wanted to ensure their complete examination. It may be hoped that at no distant date Major Delasseau, the Political Agent of Dh&#225;r, whose opportunities are not more special than his knowledge, may be able to prepare a complete description of the hill and of its many ruins and writings.

Long before 1819 too, Mar&#225;tha influence was on the wane before the rising fortunes of the British. Between these two dates however is comprised the whole or nearly the whole of the period during which the Mar&#225;th&#225;s were virtually paramount in Gujar&#225;t. From each of these two dates the political history took a new departure, and on this account they serve respectively to denote the starting point and terminus of Mar&#225;tha supremacy. Most of what took place before 1760 is so interwoven with the interests and intrigues of the Muhammadan delegates of the court of Dehli that it has been fully described in the history of the Musalm&#225;n Period. It is however necessary, in order to trace the growth of Mar&#225;tha power, to briefly set forth in a continuous narrative the events in which this race was principally concerned, adding such as transpired independently of Musalm&#225;n politics. This task is rendered easier by the very nature of Mar&#225;tha policy, which has left little to be recorded of its action in Gujar&#225;t beyond the deeds and fortunes of its initiators and their adherents.

 </p><p>The connection of the Mar&#225;th&#225;s with Gujar&#225;t can be divided by the chronicler into the following periods. First, the time of predatory inroads from 1664 to 1743, before the leaders of these expeditions had permanently established themselves within the province. Secondly, what may be termed the mercenary period, when the Mar&#225;th&#225;s partly by independent action, but far more by a course of judicious interference in the quarrels of the Muhammadan officials and by loans of troops, had acquired considerable territorial advantages. Towards the end of this period, as has been already seen, their aid was usually sufficient to ensure the success of the side which had managed to secure it, and at last the capital itself was claimed and held by them. Then came the time of domination, from 1760 to 1801, during which period the G&#225;ikw&#225;r influence was occasionally greater than that of the Peshwa. From 1802, internal dissensions at the courts of Poona and Baroda weakened the hold the Mar&#225;th&#225;s had on the province, and the paramount power had to all intents and purposes passed over to the British long before the downfall of B&#225;jir&#225;v Peshwa and the final annexation of his rights and territory in 1819. <pb id="pb386" n="386"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item></list> </fw>Shortly after, when the G&#225;ikw&#225;r made over to the British the work of collecting the tribute from K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a, Mar&#225;tha supremacy came to an end.

 </p><p><note place="margin">&#346;iv&#225;ji&#8217;s First Inroad, 1664.</note>The first Mar&#225;tha force that made its appearance in Gujar&#225;t was led there early in 1664 by &#346;iv&#225;ji. This leader was at the time engaged in a warfare with the Mughals, which, however desultory, required him to keep up a much larger force than could be supported out of the revenues of his dominions. He therefore looked to plunder to supply the deficiency, and Surat, then the richest town of Western India, was marked down by him as an easy prey. His mode of attack was cautious. He first sent one Bahirji N&#225;ik to spy out the country and report the chances of a rich booty, whilst he himself moved a force up to Junnar on pretence of visiting some forts in that direction recently acquired by one of his subordinates. On receiving a favourable report from Bahirji, &#346;iv&#225;ji gave out that he was going to perform religious ceremonies at N&#225;sik, and taking with him 4000 picked horsemen, he marched suddenly down the Gh&#225;ts and through the D&#225;ng jungles, and appeared before Surat. There he found an insignificant garrison, so he rested outside the city six days whilst his men plundered at their leisure. On hearing of the tardy approach of a relieving force sent by the governor of Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d, &#346;iv&#225;ji beat a retreat with all his booty to the stronghold of R&#225;ygad. By the time the reinforcement reached Surat, the only trace of the invaders was the emptied coffers of the inhabitants. About the same time, or shortly after, the fleet which &#346;iv&#225;ji had equipped at Alib&#225;g about two years before came up to the mouth of the gulf of Cambay and carried off one or two Mughal ships which were conveying to Makka large numbers of pilgrims with their rich oblations.<note id="n386.1" n="1">Surat was known as B&#225;b-ul-makkah or the Gate of Makka on account of its being the starting place of the ships annually conveying the Muhammadan pilgrims of India to the shrine of their Prophet.</note>

 </p><p><note place="margin">&#346;iv&#225;ji&#8217;s Second Attack, 1670.</note>This insult to the Muhammadan religion was enough to incense the bigoted Aurangzeb, apart from the additional offences of the sack of Surat and the assumption in 1665 of royal insignia by &#346;iv&#225;ji. He therefore sent an expedition to the Dakhan strong enough to keep the Mar&#225;th&#225;s for some time away from Gujar&#225;t. One of &#346;iv&#225;ji&#8217;s officers, however, seems to have attacked a part of the Surat district in 1666, and to have got off safely with his spoils. In 1670, &#346;iv&#225;ji again descended upon that city with about 15,000 men. The only serious resistance he experienced was, as before, from the English factors. He plundered the town for three days, and only left on receiving some information about the Mughals&#8217; movements in the Dakhan, which made him fear lest he should be intercepted on his way back to the country about the Gh&#225;ts.

 </p><p><note place="margin">1671.</note>&#346;iv&#225;ji left a claim for twelve l&#225;khs of rupees to be paid as a guarantee against future expeditions. It is possible, however, that as he does not appear to have taken any immediate steps to recover this sum, the demand was made only in accordance with Mar&#225;tha policy, <pb id="pb387" n="387"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item></list> </fw>which looked upon a country once overrun as tributary, and assumed a right to exercise paramount authority over it by virtue of the completed act of a successful invasion. In 1671 the Mar&#225;tha fleet was ordered to sail up the gulf and plunder Broach, and it is probable that &#346;iv&#225;ji intended at the same time to levy tribute from Surat, but the whole expedition was countermanded before the ships sailed.

 </p><p>The conduct of the military authorities in Gujar&#225;t with regard to this expedition of 1670 was such as to render it highly probable that the Mughal leaders were in complicity with the Mar&#225;th&#225;s in order to gain the favour and support of their leader. Shortly before &#346;iv&#225;ji&#8217;s arrival there had been a large garrison in Surat, apparently kept there by the governor, who suspected that some attempt on the town would soon be made. This garrison was withdrawn before &#346;iv&#225;ji&#8217;s attack, and almost immediately after his departure 5000 men were sent back again. The commanders of the Mughal army in the Dakhan were Jasvant Singh the R&#225;htor chief of Jodhpur and prince Muazzam. Jasvant Singh had been viceroy of Gujar&#225;t from <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1659 to 1662, and in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1671 shortly after &#346;iv&#225;ji&#8217;s second expedition was re-appointed to that post for three years. He had, moreover, been accused of taking bribes from &#346;iv&#225;ji during the operations in the Dakhan. Prince Muazzam, again, had every reason for wishing to secure to himself so powerful an ally as &#346;iv&#225;ji in the struggle for the imperial crown that took place, as a rule, at every succession. Aurangzeb, reasoning from his own experiences as a son, refused to allow a possible heir to his throne to become powerful at court; and accordingly sent him against &#346;iv&#225;ji with an army quite inadequate for such operations. It is therefore not unreasonable to suppose that if there had not been some previous understanding between &#346;iv&#225;ji and the Mughal leaders, the troops that were known to be within easy reach of Surat would have been found strong and numerous enough either to have repulsed him altogether or at least to have prevented the three days&#8217; sack of the city.

 </p><p><note place="margin">S&#225;ler Taken, 1672.</note>In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1672 &#346;iv&#225;ji took some of the small forts to the south of Surat, such as P&#225;rnera and Bagv&#225;da, now in the P&#225;rdi sub-division of the Surat district, whilst Moro Trimal got possession of the large fort of S&#225;ler in B&#225;gl&#225;n, which guarded one of the most frequented passes from the Dakhan into Gujar&#225;t. The Mar&#225;th&#225;s were thus able to command the routes along which their expeditions could most conveniently be despatched.

 </p><p><note place="margin">The Narbada Crossed, 1675.</note>No further incursion was made till 1675, in which year a Mar&#225;tha force first crossed the Narbada. On the resumption of hostilities between &#346;iv&#225;ji and the Mughals, Has&#225;ji Mohite, who had been made Sen&#225;pati, with the title of Hambirr&#225;v, marched up the North Konkan, and divided his army into two forces near Surat. One portion plundered towards Burh&#225;npur, the other commanded by himself plundered the Broach district. Ten years later a successful expedition was made against Broach itself, either preconcerted or <pb id="pb388" n="388"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item></list> </fw>actually led by a younger son of Aurangzeb, who had taken refuge with the Mar&#225;th&#225;s. Broach was plundered, and the booty safely carried off before the local force could get near the invaders. Gujar&#225;t was now left free from inroad for some fourteen years, probably because the attention of the Mar&#225;tha leaders was concentrated on their quarrels in the Dakhan.

This chief, whose name was afterwards so intimately connected with Gujar&#225;t, not only collected all that was due to his master from the village officers in B&#225;gl&#225;n, but also made an incursion into the Surat districts on his own account. <note place="margin">1700&#8211;1704.</note>Between 1700 and 1704 Khander&#225;v attempted two expeditions, but was foiled by the vigilance of the Mughal authorities. <note place="margin">1705.</note>In 1705, however, he made a raid on a large scale and got safely across the Narbada, where he defeated two Muhammadan detachments sent against him, and got back to S&#225;ler with his booty. <note place="margin">1706&#8211;1711.</note>Khander&#225;v now kept bodies of troops constantly hovering on the outskirts of Gujar&#225;t and along the road to Burh&#225;npur. He himself led several expeditions into the Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d territory, and is said to have once got as far as Sorath in the peninsula, where however he was repelled by the Musalm&#225;n governor. In 1711, again he was severely defeated by the Mughals near Anklesvar in the Broach district, and had to withdraw to the borders of Kh&#225;ndesh.

 </p><p><note place="margin">1713.</note>In 1713 some treasure was being conveyed from Surat to Aurang&#225;b&#225;d escorted by a large force under Muhammad Tabr&#237;z&#237;. The party was attacked in the jungles east of Surat and the treasure carried off. Just before this, Sarbuland Kh&#225;n, the deputy viceroy, on his way to take up his office at Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d, was attacked and robbed in the wilds of S&#225;gb&#225;ra on the north bank of the T&#225;pti. As Khander&#225;v had a short while previous to these occurrences taken up his position near N&#225;ndod<note id="n388.2" n="2">Now the capital of the R&#225;ja of R&#225;jpipla.</note> in the R&#225;jpipla territory, it is probably to him or to his subordinates that these raids are to be attributed. He managed by a system of outposts to cut off communication between Surat and Burh&#225;npur, except for those who had paid him a fee for safe conduct. If this charge was evaded or resisted, he appropriated one-fourth of the property that the traveller was conveying up country.

 </p><p><note place="margin">D&#225;bh&#225;de, 1716.</note>As the Burh&#225;npur road was one of those most frequented by both pilgrims and merchants, the Dehli authorities were obliged, in 1716, to organize an expedition against D&#225;bh&#225;de. The leader of the force was one Zulfikar Beg, an officer inexperienced in Mar&#225;tha warfare. D&#225;bh&#225;de found little difficulty in decoying him into a mountainous country, and there completely defeated him with the usual Mar&#225;tha accompaniment of plunder.

He was lucky enough to arrive just as the Sen&#225;pati Man&#225;ji Mor&#225;r had failed on an important expedition and was consequently in disgrace. R&#225;ja Sh&#225;hu, pleased with Khander&#225;v&#8217;s recent success against the Delhi troops, divested Man&#225;ji of the title of Sen&#225;pati, and bestowed it upon the more fortunate leader.

 </p><p><note place="margin">The Peshwa&#8217;s Negotiations, 1717.</note>Khander&#225;v remained away from Gujar&#225;t for three years, accompanying, meanwhile, <corr sic="B&#225;laji">B&#225;l&#225;ji</corr> Vishvan&#225;th the Peshwa to Dehli, where the latter was engaged in negotiations for the confirmation of the Mar&#225;tha rights to <hi>chauth</hi> and other tribute from certain districts in the Dakhan.

 </p><p>It is evident that at this time there was no definite claim to tribute from Gujar&#225;t on the part of the Mar&#225;tha government; for in spite of the intrigues of B&#225;l&#225;ji and the weakness of the court party at Delhi no concessions were obtained with regard to it, although the Mar&#225;tha dues from other parts of the country were fully ratified. The grounds on which B&#225;l&#225;ji demanded the tribute from Gujar&#225;t were that Sh&#225;hu would thereby gain the right to restrain the excesses of Mar&#225;tha freebooters from the frontier and would guarantee the whole country against irregular pillage. The argument was a curious one, considering that the most troublesome and notorious freebooter of the whole tribe was at the elbow of the envoy, who was so strenuously pleading for the right to suppress him. It is probable that B&#225;l&#225;ji foresaw that Khander&#225;v&#8217;s newly acquired rank would take him for a time from B&#225;gl&#225;n to the court, so that meanwhile an arrangement could be made to prevent the growth of any powerful chief in the Gujar&#225;t direction who might interfere with the plans of the central government. The Mar&#225;tha statesman was as anxious to ensure the subordination of distant feudatories as the Mughals to secure the freedom of the Gh&#225;t roads to the coast.

 </p><p>In the redistribution of authority carried out about this time by B&#225;l&#225;ji Vishvan&#225;th, the responsibility of collecting the Mar&#225;tha dues<note id="n389.1" n="1"><hi>Chauth</hi> and <hi>Sardeshmukhi</hi> as settled in 1699.</note> from Gujar&#225;t and B&#225;gl&#225;n was assigned to Khander&#225;v as <corr sic="Sen&#225;p&#225;ti">Sen&#225;pati</corr> or commander-in-chief; but as these dues were not yet settled, at least as regards the country below the Gh&#225;ts, Khander&#225;v seems to have remained with the Peshwa in the field.

The latter promoted D&#225;m&#225;ji to be second in command to Khander&#225;v with the title of Shamsher Bah&#225;dur, which had been formerly borne by one of the Atole family in 1692. This is the first mention of the present ruling family of Baroda. Before many months both Khander&#225;v and D&#225;m&#225;ji died. The former was succeeded by his son Trimbakr&#225;v, on whom his father&#8217;s title was conferred.

As soon as he could collect a sufficiently strong force, he attacked the Surat district and defeated the Musalm&#225;n commander close to the city itself. After extorting from him a handsome sum as ransom, Pil&#225;ji returned eastwards. He selected Songad,<note id="n390.1" n="1">On the western skirts of the D&#225;ng forests.</note> a fort about fifty miles east of Surat, as his headquarters, and from thence made continual excursions against the neighbouring towns. He once attacked Surat, but although he defeated the Mughal leader, he seems to have contented himself with contributions levied from the adjacent country, and not to have entered the town. Pil&#225;ji soon obtained possession of some strongholds in the <note place="margin">1723.</note>R&#225;jpipla country between N&#225;ndod and S&#225;gb&#225;ra, which he fortified, as Khander&#225;v D&#225;bh&#225;de had formerly done. Here he resided as representative of the Sen&#225;pati, whose family had removed for a while to the Dakhan. The tribute collected from B&#225;gl&#225;n and Gujar&#225;t was supposed to be transmitted by Pil&#225;ji to the royal treasury through the Peshwa; but there is no record of these dues having been levied with any regularity or even fixed at any special amount. Whilst Trimbakr&#225;v was taking an active part in the affairs of his royal patron in the Dakhan, Pil&#225;ji occupied himself in sedulously cultivating the goodwill of the border tribes surrounding his residence in Gujar&#225;t.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Mar&#225;tha Tribute, 1723.</note>The year 1723 is noteworthy as being the date of the first imposition of the regular Mar&#225;tha demand of one-fourth, <hi>chauth</hi>, and one-tenth, <hi>sardeshmukhi</hi>, of the revenue of Gujar&#225;t. Whilst Pil&#225;ji was directing his attacks against Surat and the south of the province another of R&#225;ja Sh&#225;hu&#8217;s officers, who had been sent up towards M&#225;lwa, entered Gujar&#225;t by the north-east, and after ravaging the country round Dohad,<note id="n390.2" n="2">Now in the British districts of the Panch Mah&#225;ls.</note> settled a fixed tribute on the district.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Kant&#225;ji Kadam.</note>This officer, Kant&#225;ji Kadam B&#225;nde, was soon after engaged by one of the parties struggling for the viceroyalty of Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d to bring his cavalry into the province and take part in the civil war. The leader of the opposite party, Rustam Ali, enlisted the services of Pil&#225;ji G&#225;ikw&#225;r. The Niz&#225;m-ul-Mulk, whose influence in the Dakhan was very great, managed to detach Pil&#225;ji from Rustam Ali&#8217;s side. This was the easier, as Rustam had already defeated Pil&#225;ji more than once in attacks by the latter against Surat, of which district Rustam was governor. There are two different accounts<note id="n390.3" n="3">The Muhammadan account is given in the Musalm&#225;n portion of this history. Grant Duff&#8217;s description differs considerably.</note> of what took place when the rival forces came into action, but both show clearly that the Mar&#225;tha leaders acted on both sides with utter disregard of their agreements and looked only to plundering the Muhammadan camps whilst the soldiers were engaged in battle. After the defeat of Rustam, the two Mar&#225;tha chiefs joined forces and proceeded to levy <hi>chauth</hi>, of which the Mughal deputy had granted Pil&#225;ji a share equal to that of his first ally Kant&#225;ji.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Mar&#225;tha Dissensions, 1725.</note>This division led to quarrels and at last to an open rupture between the two Mar&#225;tha leaders, which was only patched up by the <pb id="pb391" n="391"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item></list> </fw>grant of the <hi>chauth</hi> north of the Mahi river to Kant&#225;ji and of that to the south to Pil&#225;ji. The chief ground of quarrel seems to have been the relative position of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r as agent for the Sen&#225;pati, who had a right to collect all dues from Gujar&#225;t, and of Kant&#225;ji, who claimed superior rank as holding his commission direct from R&#225;ja Sh&#225;hu. On hearing of this dispute and the consequent partition of the Mar&#225;tha tribute, <corr sic="Trimbakrav">Trimbakr&#225;v</corr> D&#225;bh&#225;de himself hastened up to Cambay with an army, but effected nothing, and seems to have retired, leaving Pil&#225;ji to look after his interests at Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d. Both the latter, however, and Kant&#225;ji soon after withdrew from Gujar&#225;t, but were within a short period encouraged to return by the success of a raid made by another leader, Ant&#225;ji Bh&#225;skar, on the north-east district. They both joined Hamid Kh&#225;n in his resistance to the new viceroy, but received several checks from the Muhammadan army, and after plundering again returned to their strongholds for the rainy season.

 </p><p><note place="margin">The Peshwa, 1726.</note>Next year they returned for the tribute and plundered as usual. The Peshwa B&#225;jir&#225;v then opened for the first time direct negotiations with the viceroy of Gujar&#225;t. The rapid increase of the authority of the Br&#225;hman ministers at the R&#225;ja&#8217;s court in the Dakhan had aroused the jealousy of the Mar&#225;tha nobles, amongst whom Trimbakr&#225;v D&#225;bh&#225;de was one of the most influential. B&#225;jir&#225;v, being fully aware of the fact, and having by this time acquired from the R&#225;ja the power of acting with foreign powers independently of the throne, determined to undermine Trimbakr&#225;v&#8217;s authority in Gujar&#225;t by aiming at the rights said to have been formally granted to him by Hamid Kh&#225;n over the country south of the Mahi. He therefore applied to the viceroy for a confirmation of the right to levy <hi>chauth</hi> and <hi>sardeshmukhi</hi> over the whole country, on condition that he would protect it from the inroads of Kant&#225;ji, Pil&#225;ji, and other irresponsible freebooters. The viceroy had still some resources left at his disposal and was in hopes that his repeated applications to Dehli for assistance would soon meet with a favourable answer. <note place="margin">Cession of Tribute, 1728.</note>He declined therefore to accede to B&#225;jir&#225;v&#8217;s proposals at once, on the grounds that the court at Dehli had repudiated the concessions made to Pil&#225;ji and Kant&#225;ji by his predecessor&#8217;s deputy. As however the depredations on the frontier caused serious injury both to the revenues and the people, he allowed the Peshwa to send a feudatory, Ud&#225;ji Pav&#225;r, chief of Dh&#225;r, through the Mughal territories to operate against Pil&#225;ji. The latter, who was fully aware of these negotiations, persuaded Kant&#225;ji to join him in expelling the agents of the Peshwa party, as it was clear that if Pil&#225;ji&#8217;s forces were scattered the way would be open for Ud&#225;ji to attack Kant&#225;ji himself. The two then proceeded to Baroda and after a while drove back Ud&#225;ji, and occupied Baroda and Dabhoi. Here Pil&#225;ji remained, and next year Kant&#225;ji succeeded in taking Ch&#225;mp&#225;ner, thus advancing his posts nearer the centre of the province. With such an advantage gained these two chiefs instituted raids still more frequently than before. In these straits, and finding himself utterly neglected by the emperor, the viceroy re-opened negotiations with the Peshwa, who lost no time in sending his <pb id="pb392" n="392"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item><item>Cession of Tribute, 1728.</item></list> </fw>brother Chimn&#225;ji &#193;ppa with an army through Gujar&#225;t. <corr sic="Petlad">Petl&#225;d</corr> and Dholka were plundered, but Kant&#225;ji was left undisturbed, so he took this opportunity of marching to Sorath, where he remained for some time extorting tribute. The viceroy agreed formally to cede the <hi><corr sic="sardesmukhi">sardeshmukhi</corr></hi> of the whole revenue, land and customs (with the exception of the port of Surat and the districts attached to it) and the <hi>chauth</hi> of the same district, with five per cent on the revenue from the city of Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d. Special clauses were inserted in the grant of <hi>chauth</hi> to suit the convenience of both the Peshwa and the viceroy. The latter stipulated that as few collectors as possible should be kept by the Mar&#225;th&#225;s in the districts under tribute, and that no extra demands beyond the one-fourth should be made. He also insisted that the percentage should be calculated on the actual collections and not on the <hi>kam&#225;l</hi> or highest sum recorded as having been collected.<note id="n392.1" n="1">The Mar&#225;tha practice was to base their demands on the standard or <hi>tankha</hi> assessment (which was seldom if ever collected), so that by this means they evaded all possibility of claims against them for over-collections.</note> The Mar&#225;th&#225;s were also to support the imperial authority and to keep up a body of horse. The Peshwa agreed (probably at his own request) to prevent all Mar&#225;tha subjects from joining disaffected chiefs, or other turbulent characters, thus receiving the right to suppress Kant&#225;ji and Pil&#225;ji, as well as the Bhils and Kolis with whom the latter was on such friendly terms.

 </p><p>After this agreement was executed, B&#225;jir&#225;v made over part of the <hi>sardeshmukhi</hi> to the D&#225;bh&#225;de, as well as the <hi>mok&#226;sa</hi> or three-fourths of the <hi>svar&#225;j</hi> as settled by B&#225;l&#225;ji Vishvan&#225;th. The consideration as set forth in the preamble of this agreement was the great improvement effected by the Mar&#225;tha rulers as regards the wealth and tranquillity of the Dakhan provinces. This was inserted either to give the transaction the appearance of having been executed on the part of the emperor (for otherwise the viceroy had no concern in the state of the Dakhan), or simply as an expression of gratitude on the part of this special viceroy towards the Mar&#225;th&#225;s who had just brought to terms the Niz&#225;m-ul-Mulk, his former rival and enemy. It is even probable that it was merely intended, as usual with such preambles, to veil the forced nature of the treaty.

 </p><p>The hostile movements of the Pratinidhi in the Southern Mar&#225;tha Country induced the Peshwa to return to the Dakhan. Kant&#225;ji returned from Sorath to Ch&#225;mp&#225;ner, plundering part of the viceroy&#8217;s camp on his way. Trimbakr&#225;v D&#225;bh&#225;de, jealous of the interference of the Peshwa in the affairs of Gujar&#225;t, began to intrigue with other chiefs to overturn the power of the Br&#225;hman ministers.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Coalition against the Peshwa, 1730.</note>As soon as Niz&#225;m-ul-Mulk became aware of this discontent on the part of Trimbakr&#225;v, of whose power he was well informed, he proposed to assist him by an attack on the Peshwa from the east, whilst the Mar&#225;th&#225;s operated in another direction. Trimbakr&#225;v was successful in his overtures with Pil&#225;ji G&#225;ikw&#225;r, the B&#225;nde, the Pav&#225;rs, and a few other chiefs resident in Kh&#225;ndesh or the north Dakhan. The troops sent by them to join his standard soon amounted <pb id="pb393" n="393"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item></list> </fw>to 35,000 men, who were collected in Gujar&#225;t. He then gave out that he was bent on rescuing the Mar&#225;tha R&#225;ja from the thraldom in which he was being kept by the Br&#225;hmans. The Peshwa, who had discovered the intercourse between Trimbakr&#225;v and the Niz&#225;m, proclaimed this treason on the part of the D&#225;bh&#225;de as a royal officer, and stated that the malcontents were only planning the partition of the inheritance of Shiv&#225;ji between the R&#225;ja of Kolh&#225;pur and themselves. As soon as he found the Niz&#225;m&#8217;s troops were on the march, he collected his picked men and advanced on the D&#225;bh&#225;de in Gujar&#225;t.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Defeat of the Allies, 1731.</note>The Peshwa&#8217;s army was inferior in numbers but consisted of better trained men. He closed at once with the allies near Dabhoi, and easily defeated the undisciplined forces of the Pav&#225;rs and B&#225;nde. The D&#225;bh&#225;de&#8217;s army, however, had more experience of regular warfare and made a stand. But a stray shot killed Trimbakr&#225;v as he was endeavouring to rally the forces of his allies, and as usual in such engagements, the loss of the leader disheartened the army. Utter confusion ensued, in which many of the nobles fell, others ran away, and the Peshwa, without the necessity of pushing further his advantage, made good his retreat to the Dakhan. The Niz&#225;m, who was in pursuit, only managed to capture some of the baggage with the rear guard as it was crossing the T&#225;pti near Surat.<note id="n393.1" n="1">At Gala about twelve miles above Surat in the territory of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r.</note>

 </p><p>Safe again in the Dakhan, the Peshwa at once began negotiations with both the Niz&#225;m and the adherents of Trimbakr&#225;v D&#225;bh&#225;de. He recognized the rights of the former to some possessions in Gujar&#225;t independent of the viceroy of Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d, and agreed to further his designs of severing the Dakhan from the possessions of the emperor. He conciliated the D&#225;bh&#225;de family by establishing at Poona an annual distribution of food and presents to Br&#225;hmans such as had formerly been the practice in the native village of Khander&#225;v.<note id="n393.2" n="2">T&#225;legaon in the north-west of Poona, now a station on the railway to Bombay.</note> This institution was known as Dakshin&#225;.

 </p><p>B&#225;jir&#225;v acquiesced also in the general tendency amongst Mar&#225;th&#225;s of all offices to become hereditary, and conferred the title of Sen&#225;pati on Yeshvantr&#225;v the minor son of the deceased Trimbakr&#225;v. The widow Um&#225;b&#225;i became guardian, and Pil&#225;ji G&#225;ikw&#225;r deputy or <hi>mut&#225;lik</hi> in Gujar&#225;t. This latter appointment seems to have been made by the Peshwa and not by the D&#225;bh&#225;de, for Pil&#225;ji received at the same time a new title, namely that of <hi>Sen&#225; Kh&#225;s Khel</hi> or commander of the special band or perhaps the household brigade. He was also bound on behalf of the Sen&#225;pati to respect the Peshwa&#8217;s rights in M&#225;lwa and Gujar&#225;t, and to pay half the collections from the territory he administered to the royal treasury through the minister. A provision was also inserted with regard to future acquisitions. This reciprocal agreement was executed at the special command of the Mar&#225;tha R&#225;ja Sh&#225;hu, who had not yet quite abrogated his authority in favour of the Peshwa. Pil&#225;ji after these negotiations retired to Gujar&#225;t.

This event took place at D&#225;kor in the Kaira district. The followers of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r slew the assassin and retired south of the Mahi. They were driven by the Mughals out of Baroda, but continued to hold Dabhoi. D&#225;m&#225;ji G&#225;ikw&#225;r, son of Pil&#225;ji, was at this time prowling round Surat watching for an opportunity of interfering in the disturbed affairs of that town. One of the candidates for the governorship had offered him one-fourth the revenue of the city for his assistance, but the expedition was deferred on account of the appointment of a rival by the emperor. D&#225;m&#225;ji therefore was preparing to act on his own account independently of his ally. The news of his father&#8217;s assassination, however, took him northwards. He found that the Des&#225;i of P&#225;dra near Baroda had stirred up the Bhils and Kolis to revolt, in order to give the relations of Pil&#225;ji a chance of striking a blow at the murderers of their deceased leader. <note place="margin">1733.</note>Um&#225;b&#225;i D&#225;bh&#225;de, too, bent on the same errand, moved down the Gh&#225;ts with an army. The Mar&#225;th&#225;s were bought off, however, by the viceroy and peace was restored for a while.

 </p><p><note place="margin">G&#225;ikw&#225;rs Secure Baroda, 1734.</note>In this year also J&#225;doji, a younger son of Trimbakr&#225;v, made an expedition to collect tribute through Gujar&#225;t as far as Sorath. Next year M&#225;dhavr&#225;v G&#225;ikw&#225;r, brother of Pil&#225;ji, obtained possession of Baroda during the absence of Sher Kh&#225;n B&#225;bi the governor. Since that date this town has been the capital of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r family. Sindia and Holkar soon afterwards joined the chief of &#205;dar against the Musalm&#225;n deputy, and extorted from the latter a considerable sum as ransom.

Kant&#225;ji Kadam, who as a partisan of the Peshwa was hostile to the Sen&#225;pati, harassed the country within reach of his frontier. D&#225;m&#225;ji, meanwhile, had again proceeded to the Dakhan, where Um&#225;b&#225;i was intriguing against the Peshwa and required all the help she could obtain to further the ambitious schemes she was devising in the name of her half-witted son. His deputy Rangoji, by demanding a heavy price for his aid at a time when an aspirant to the viceroyalty of Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d was in distress, managed to secure for the Mar&#225;th&#225;s half the revenue of Gujar&#225;t with certain exceptions.

The events of this year have been detailed in full in the history of the Musalm&#225;n Period. After getting possession of a great part of the city of Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d the <note place="margin">1739.</note>Mar&#225;th&#225;s, by their oppressive rule, excited a rising amongst the Musalm&#225;n inhabitants. Similar quarrels and subsequent reconciliations took place between 1739 and 1741, the Musalm&#225;ns distrusting the Mar&#225;th&#225;s, yet not daring to attempt to oust them. D&#225;m&#225;ji, on his way back from one of his Sorath expeditions, laid <note place="margin">1741.</note>siege to Broach, which was held by a Muhammadan officer direct from the viceroy of the Dakhan.<note id="n395.1" n="1">Broach was constituted part of the Niz&#225;m&#8217;s personal estate on his resigning the viceroyalty in 1722.</note> As the latter personage was still regarded by the Mar&#225;tha chiefs as a possible ally against the Peshwa, D&#225;m&#225;ji at once obeyed the request of the Niz&#225;m to raise the siege, but probably obtained a promise of future concessions such as he had acquired at Surat.

 </p><p><note place="margin">1742.</note>Rangoji in the absence of D&#225;m&#225;ji took up his residence in Borsad. There he fell into several disputes with the Muhammadan officials, in the course of one of which he was taken prisoner, but escaped the next year (1743). Meanwhile D&#225;m&#225;ji had joined with R&#225;ghoji Bhonsl&#233; in attacking the Peshwa. Whilst R&#225;ghoji was preparing his army in the east, D&#225;m&#225;ji made a feint against M&#225;lwa, which had the desired effect of withdrawing a large portion of the ministerial army. The G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s troops retreated without giving battle, but to prevent any future junction between D&#225;m&#225;ji and the Bhonsl&#233; party in Ber&#225;r, B&#225;l&#225;ji Peshwa confirmed the Pav&#225;r family in their claims to Dh&#225;r, which had never been acknowledged as their territory since the defection of the Pav&#225;rs to the D&#225;bh&#225;de party in 1731. It is worth remarking that though the rank of Sen&#225;pati had apparently been made hereditary in the D&#225;bh&#225;de family (for the owner of the title was quite unfit for the command of an army), the Ghorpad&#233; family applied at this time to have it restored to them on the ground that it once had been held by one of their house. The Peshwa, however, managed to secure their alliance by a grant of land, and their claims to the chief command of the army seem to have been waived.

 </p><p><note place="margin">1743&#8211;44.</note>For the next two years the Mar&#225;tha force in Gujar&#225;t under Rangoji and Dev&#225;ji T&#225;kpar was employed by the Musalm&#225;ns in their quarrels regarding the viceroyalty. The Mar&#225;tha practice of appointing deputies gives rise to some confusion as to the negotiations that took place about this time between the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s party and the rival candidates for the office of subhed&#225;r. For instance, Um&#225;b&#225;i D&#225;bh&#225;de had appointed the G&#225;ikw&#225;r family as her agents-in-chief, but the principal members of that house were absent in the Dakhan. D&#225;m&#225;ji G&#225;ikw&#225;r had appointed Rangoji, who in his turn left one Krishn&#225;ji in charge of the Mar&#225;tha share of the city of Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d. On the departure, however, of D&#225;m&#225;ji from Gujar&#225;t, Um&#225;b&#225;i left R&#225;m&#225;ji as her agent. R&#225;m&#225;ji, who seems to have <pb id="pb396" n="396"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item></list> </fw>been employed previously by D&#225;m&#225;ji, followed the example of his <corr sic="predecesors">predecessors</corr> and placed one R&#225;mchandra in charge at Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d. There does not appear to have been any direct agent of the Peshwa in Gujar&#225;t at this time.

 </p><p><note place="margin">1745.</note>On Khander&#225;v G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s return from the Dakhan he demanded the <corr sic="acounts">accounts</corr> of the tribute from Rangoji, and not being satisfied with this agent confined him in Borsad and appointed one Trimbakr&#225;v in his place. Um&#225;b&#225;i caused Rangoji to be set at liberty and sent to her in the Dakhan, after which she reappointed him her agent. He expelled Trimbakr&#225;v from Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d, but was attacked by Krishn&#225;ji and Gang&#225;dhar, two other late deputies. D&#225;m&#225;ji and Khander&#225;v were obliged at last to come to Gujar&#225;t and summon all these deputies to their presence. A private arrangement was concluded under which Khander&#225;v was allowed by D&#225;m&#225;ji to keep Na&#7693;i&#225;d and Borsad as a private estate and to act as the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s deputy at Baroda. Rangoji was to live at Umreth when not on active service. Gang&#225;dhar and Krishn&#225;ji were censured and forbidden to engage in any independent alliances with the Muhammadan leaders.

 </p><p><note place="margin">1746.</note>After this D&#225;m&#225;ji sent a general named K&#225;noji T&#225;kpar to collect the Sorath tribute whilst he himself retired to Songad.

 </p><p>Rangoji returned to Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d, and not long after began to quarrel with the viceroy about the Mar&#225;tha share in the revenue of the city ceded in 1728.

 </p><p><note place="margin">The G&#225;ikw&#225;r in Surat, 1747.</note>In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1747 Ked&#225;rji G&#225;ikw&#225;r, cousin of D&#225;m&#225;ji, was asked by Syed Achchan, an aspirant to the governorship of Surat, to assist him in maintaining possession of that city. Before Ked&#225;rji could reach Surat the disputes as to the succession had been settled by negotiations, and the aid of Mar&#225;tha troops was no longer required. Ked&#225;rji, however, finding himself in a position to dictate terms, demanded three l&#225;khs of rupees for the aid that he was prepared to give, and as the Surat treasury could not afford to pay this sum in cash, one-third of the revenues of Surat was promised to the G&#225;ikw&#225;r.

 </p><p><note place="margin">1748.</note>Rangoji meanwhile attacked Harib&#225;, an adopted son of Khander&#225;v G&#225;ikw&#225;r, and recovered from him the town and fort of Borsad, which had been seized during the time that Rangoji had been occupied with his disputes in Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d. Khander&#225;v and D&#225;m&#225;ji both turned against him and captured the fort after a long siege. Rangoji was then again imprisoned, and not released until the next year when the Peshwa sent a body of troops into Gujar&#225;t. In 1748 Um&#225;b&#225;i, widow of Trimbakr&#225;v D&#225;bh&#225;de, died, leaving one B&#225;bur&#225;v guardian of Yeshv&#225;ntr&#225;v her son. Partly through the solicitations of Khander&#225;v, who had private influence with the D&#225;bh&#225;des, partly from the fact of previous possession, D&#225;m&#225;ji was confirmed as deputy of the Mar&#225;th&#225;s in Gujar&#225;t. He there began to collect an army as quickly as possible, in order to co-operate with Raghun&#225;th Bhonsl&#233; against the Peshwa, in answer to an appeal by Sakv&#225;rb&#225;i, widow of Sh&#225;hu, to support the throne against the ministers, and to secure the <pb id="pb397" n="397"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item></list> </fw>succession of Sambh&#225;ji to the S&#225;t&#225;ra kingdom. The Peshwa, aware of D&#225;m&#225;ji&#8217;s ill-will towards himself, did his best to foment disturbances in Gujar&#225;t and to extend his own influence there so as to keep D&#225;m&#225;ji away from the Dakhan.

 </p><p><note place="margin">1750.</note>The Peshwa accordingly entered into some negotiations with Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n, then in power at Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d, but was unable to lend substantial aid in Gujar&#225;t against D&#225;m&#225;ji&#8217;s agents, as the whole Mar&#225;tha power was required in the Dakhan to operate against the son of the late Niz&#225;m-ul-Mulk.

 </p><p><note place="margin">D&#225;m&#225;ji G&#225;ikw&#225;r Arrested, 1751.</note>Next year D&#225;m&#225;ji, at the request of T&#225;r&#225;b&#225;i, guardian of R&#225;m R&#225;ja, ascended the Salpi gh&#225;t with a strong force, defeated the Peshwa&#8217;s army, and advanced as far as S&#225;t&#225;ra. From this position he was forced to retire, and whilst in treaty with the Peshwa was treacherously seized by the latter and put into prison. B&#225;l&#225;ji at once demanded arrears of tribute, but D&#225;m&#225;ji declined to agree to any payment, on the ground that he was no independent chief but only the agent of the Sen&#225;pati. He therefore refused to bind his principal or himself on account of what was due from his principal. B&#225;l&#225;ji then imprisoned all the members of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r and D&#225;bh&#225;de family that were at that time in the Dakhan.

 </p><p><note place="margin">The Peshwa and Surat.</note>The state of Surat was at this time such as to afford a good opportunity to the Peshwa to obtain a footing there independently of the English or of D&#225;m&#225;ji. He had recently had dealings with the former in the expeditions against &#193;ngria of Kol&#225;ba, and as the merchants had found him one of the most stable and powerful rulers of the country, they were willing to treat with him for the future security of their buildings and goods in Surat. Taking advantage of D&#225;m&#225;ji&#8217;s confinement, B&#225;l&#225;ji sent <corr sic="Ragun&#225;thr&#225;v">Raghun&#225;thr&#225;v</corr> to Gujar&#225;t. This leader, afterwards so well known as R&#225;ghoba, took possession of a few <hi>t&#225;lukas</hi> in the north-east of the province, but was recalled to the Dakhan before he could approach Surat. Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n also took advantage of D&#225;m&#225;ji&#8217;s absence to make an expedition into Sorath and K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a where the G&#225;ikw&#225;r family had now established themselves permanently.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Release of D&#225;m&#225;ji, 1752.</note>The news of these two expeditions made D&#225;m&#225;ji very eager to return to his province; and as he had full information as to B&#225;l&#225;ji&#8217;s plans with regard to Gujar&#225;t, he bribed freely, and in order to regain his liberty consented to much harsher terms than he would otherwise have done. He agreed to maintain an army for defence and collection purposes in Gujar&#225;t, as well as to furnish a contingent to the Peshwa&#8217;s army in the Dakhan, and to contribute towards the support of the R&#225;ja, now in reality a state-prisoner dependent upon the wishes of his minister. The G&#225;ikw&#225;r was also to furnish the tribute due on account of the D&#225;bh&#225;de family, whom the Peshwa was apparently trying to oust from the administration altogether. After deducting the necessary expenses of collection and defence, half the surplus revenue was to be handed over to the Peshwa. Even after acceding to all these proposals, the G&#225;ikw&#225;r was not at once released. The Peshwa protracted the negotiations, as he had <pb id="pb398" n="398"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item></list> </fw>to contend against a factious court party in whose counsels he knew D&#225;m&#225;ji would play a leading part when once set at liberty. At last, however, after agreeing to a final request that he would assist Raghun&#225;thr&#225;v against Surat, D&#225;m&#225;ji was allowed to go. There was at this time one P&#225;ndurang Pant levying tribute on behalf of the Peshwa in Cambay and Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d. The Naw&#225;b of Cambay, not having any reason to like or trust his neighbour the G&#225;ikw&#225;r, had persuaded the Peshwa at the time the partition of the Mar&#225;tha rights over Gujar&#225;t was being settled at Poona, to take Cambay into his share of the province. The Naw&#225;b bought off the agent of his ally with a present of guns and cash. The ruler of Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d also came to terms with the Mar&#225;th&#225;s, so P&#225;ndurang was at liberty to go and see if he could find equal good fortune in Sorath.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Capture of Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d, 1753.</note>D&#225;m&#225;ji now came back with a fresh army, which was soon reinforced by Raghun&#225;thr&#225;v. They marched towards Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d, and Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n was too late to intercept them before they invested the capital. He managed, however, by a bold movement to enter the town, but after a long siege was obliged to capitulate and march out with the honours of war. The Mar&#225;th&#225;s conferred on him an estate in the north-west of Gujar&#225;t, which, however, was recovered by them some time afterwards.

 </p><p>After taking possession of Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d in April 1753, Raghun&#225;thr&#225;v went to Sorath, and on his return extorted a large sum as tribute from the Naw&#225;b of Cambay. He left a deputy in Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d, <note place="margin">1754.</note>who marched against the same chief again in 1754, but on this occasion he could levy no tribute. As the Naw&#225;b had firmly established himself and considerably enlarged his dominions, the Peshwa&#8217;s deputy marched against him in person a second time, but was defeated and taken prisoner. The nominee of Raghun&#225;thr&#225;v procured his release, and the Peshwa&#8217;s deputy continued to demand <note place="margin">1755.</note>arrears of tribute for his master till he obtained an agreement to pay at a future date. He then retired to the Dakhan, and the Naw&#225;b, taking advantage of the lull to strengthen his army, captured Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d from the Mar&#225;tha garrison and established himself in the city. After a while D&#225;m&#225;ji and Khander&#225;v G&#225;ikw&#225;r, with an agent sent direct by the Peshwa, arrived before the town and commenced a siege. <note place="margin">1757.</note>It was not until April 1757 that the Mar&#225;th&#225;s again entered the city. The Naw&#225;b surrendered after the Mar&#225;th&#225;s had fully ratified the conditions he himself had proposed.

 </p><p><note place="margin">1758.</note>Say&#225;jir&#225;v, son of D&#225;m&#225;ji, remained in Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d on behalf of his father, and the Peshwa&#8217;s agent Sad&#225;shiv put in a deputy in his turn and went himself to Surat. Here he was soon joined by Say&#225;ji, who had to arrange the shares of the tribute in accordance with the partition treaty of 1751. Next year a body of Mar&#225;tha troops was sent to the aid of the R&#225;v of Kachh, who was engaged in an expedition against Thatta in Sindh. Sad&#225;shiv lent the Naw&#225;b of Cambay some money on the part of the Peshwa to enable him to liquidate the arrears of pay due to his army, but a year afterwards the Mar&#225;tha army appeared at the town gates with a demand for <pb id="pb399" n="399"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item></list> </fw>two years&#8217; arrears of tribute in full, amounting to <abbr>Rs.</abbr> 20,000. The Naw&#225;b managed to raise this sum, and the Mar&#225;th&#225;s moved south. D&#225;m&#225;ji was at this time in Poona.

 </p><p><note place="margin">1759.</note>The Peshwa had supported Syed Achchan of Surat with the view of putting him under an obligation so as to secure some future advantages, and this year lent him some troops as a bodyguard. The Naw&#225;b of Cambay, who was also indebted to the ministerial party, left his dominions to pay a visit to the Peshwa at Poona. Khander&#225;v meanwhile plundered Lun&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a and &#205;dar, whilst Say&#225;jir&#225;v was similarly engaged in Sor&#225;th.

 </p><p><note place="margin">1761.</note>D&#225;m&#225;ji G&#225;ikw&#225;r accompanied the Peshwa to Delhi, and was one of the few Mar&#225;tha leaders that escaped after the defeat at P&#225;nipat. On his return to Gujar&#225;t he successfully opposed an expedition by the Naw&#225;b of Cambay against B&#225;l&#225;sinor and re-took the estates of Jaw&#225;n Mard Kh&#225;n. He also strengthened his position in Sorath and <corr sic="K&#225;thi&#225;va&#7693;a">K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a</corr> against the Peshwa&#8217;s party.

 </p><p><note place="margin">1761.</note>The Peshwa, being hard pressed by his rival the Niz&#225;m, began in this year to make overtures to the East India Company&#8217;s officers in Bombay, with a view to getting the aid of European artillery and gunners. He at first offered to give up a valuable tract of land in <corr sic="J&#225;mbusar">Jambusar</corr>. But the English would accept no territory but the island of S&#225;lsette, the town of Bassein, and the small islands in the harbour of Bombay. These the Mar&#225;tha government declined to give up, so negotiations were broken off.

 </p><p><note place="margin">1762.</note>Next year Raghun&#225;thr&#225;v, as guardian of the son of B&#225;l&#225;ji, named M&#225;dhavr&#225;v, who was still a minor, conferred the title of Sen&#225;pati on one of the J&#225;dhav family who had formerly borne it. The administration of Gujar&#225;t, however, which had always accompanied the title when held by the D&#225;bh&#225;de family, was left practically in the hands of D&#225;m&#225;ji, and no mention of any transfer of it was made at the time J&#225;dhav was appointed commander-in-chief. Discontented with the empty honour thus conferred, R&#225;mchandra, the new Sen&#225;pati, joined the Niz&#225;m&#8217;s party, and on account of this defection the Peshwa, two years afterwards, cancelled the appointment and restored the office to the Ghorpade family, one of whose members had held it long before. This put an end to the connection of Gujar&#225;t with the chief military dignity of the Mar&#225;tha state.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Intrigues of R&#225;ghoba, 1768.</note>After M&#225;dhavr&#225;v B&#225;l&#225;ji came of age he had constantly to be on this guard against the plots of his uncle Raghun&#225;thr&#225;v, who had refused to accept the share in the government offered him by the young Peshwa. Raghun&#225;thr&#225;v, perhaps instigated by his wife, had no doubt great hopes of obtaining a share in the whole power of the administration, and suspecting M&#225;dhavr&#225;v to be aware of his designs, looked upon all the overtures made by the latter as intended in some way or other to entrap him. He therefore collected an army of some 15,000 men in B&#225;gl&#225;n and N&#225;sik, and hoping to be joined on his way by J&#225;noji Bhonsl&#233;, advanced towards Poona.

It was his personal authority alone that was able to counteract the usual tendency of quasi-independent Mar&#225;tha states towards disintegration, especially when they are at a distance from the central power. Khander&#225;v and Say&#225;jir&#225;v had shown frequent signs of insubordination (as for instance in their espousal of the cause of Rangoji) and a desire to establish themselves in an <corr sic="independant">independent</corr> position, but the sagacity of D&#225;m&#225;ji foresaw the advantage such a partition would give an enemy like the Peshwa, and his tact enabled him to preserve unity in his family, at least in resistance to what he showed them to be their common foe.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Disputed Succession.</note>The quarrel for the succession that arose on <corr sic="D&#225;m&#225;j&#8217;s">D&#225;m&#225;ji&#8217;s</corr> death was the first step towards the breaking up of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s power. D&#225;m&#225;ji had three wives. By the first he had Govindr&#225;v, who however was born after Say&#225;jir&#225;v, the son by the second wife. His sons by the third wife were M&#225;n&#225;ji and Fatesingh. Govindr&#225;v was in confinement at Poona near the court, and therefore in a position to offer conditions for the confirmation of his rights without loss of time.

 </p><p>In the Hindu law current amongst Mar&#225;th&#225;s, there are to be found precedents in favour of the heirship of either Govindr&#225;v or Say&#225;jir&#225;v. Some authorities support the rights of the son of the first wife whether he be the eldest or not, others again regard simply the age of the claimants, deciding in favour of the first born, of whatever wife he may be the son. R&#225;mr&#225;v Sh&#225;stri, the celebrated adviser of M&#225;dhavr&#225;v Peshwa, is said to have expressed an opinion in favour of the rights of Say&#225;jir&#225;v. Govindr&#225;v, however, was on the spot where his influence could be used most extensively. Say&#225;ji, moreover, was an idiot and a puppet in the hands of his half brother Fatesingh. Govindr&#225;v applied at once for investiture with the title of <corr sic="Sen&#225;-Khas-Khel">Sen&#225;-Kh&#225;s-Khel</corr>. A payment of 50&#189; l&#225;khs of rupees to the Peshwa on account of arrears of tribute and a fine for his conduct in taking part with R&#225;ghob&#225; was a strong argument in his favour, and when he agreed to a tribute previously demanded from his father of <abbr>Rs.</abbr> 7,79,000 yearly and to maintain a peace contingent at Poona of 3000 horse, to be increased by a thousand more in time of war, there could be little doubt as to the legitimacy of his claim, and he was duly invested with his father&#8217;s title and estate.

 </p><p><note place="margin">1771.</note>For reasons not apparent Say&#225;ji&#8217;s claims were not brought forward till nearly two years later. Govindr&#225;v had never been allowed to join his charge in Gujar&#225;t, so that he could exercise no interference in that direction, and the court affairs in the Dakhan left perhaps little time for the disposal of Say&#225;jir&#225;v&#8217;s application, even if it had been made. Say&#225;ji had entrusted his interests to Fatesingh, a man <pb id="pb401" n="401"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item></list> </fw>of considerable ability, who came at once to Poona to get a reversal of the recognition of Govindr&#225;v. The Peshwa was glad to have this opportunity of undoing so much of D&#225;m&#225;ji&#8217;s work and dividing the G&#225;ikw&#225;r family against itself, so using the verdict of R&#225;m Sh&#225;stri as his weapon, he cancelled the former grant in favour of Govindr&#225;v, and appointed Say&#225;jir&#225;v with Fatesingh as his <hi>mut&#225;lik</hi> or deputy. The latter, by agreeing to pay an extra sum of 6&#189; l&#225;khs of rupees annually, got permission to retain the Poona contingent of G&#225;ikw&#225;r horse in Gujar&#225;t, on the pretext that Govindr&#225;v would probably attack his brothers on the earliest opportunity. Thus, whatever happened, all went to the profit of the Peshwa&#8217;s party and to the injury of the tax-paying Gujar&#225;t ryot.

 </p><p><note place="margin">1773.</note>Fatesingh retired in triumph to Baroda, and opened negotiations with the English in Surat, as he had been endeavouring to do for a year past without success. In January 1773, however, he succeeded in getting an agreement from the Chief for Affairs of the British Nation in Surat, that his share in the revenues of the town of Broach, which had been taken by storm in 1772 by the English, should not be affected by the change of masters. In the same year N&#225;r&#225;yanr&#225;v Peshwa was murdered, and R&#225;ghob&#225; was invested by the titular king at <corr sic="S&#225;tara">S&#225;t&#225;ra</corr> with the ministerial robe of honour. Govindr&#225;v G&#225;ikw&#225;r, still in Poona, reminded the new Peshwa of the good offices of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r family at Dhorap and elsewhere, and found means of getting reinstated as Sen&#225;-Kh&#225;s-Khel. In 1774 he set out for Gujar&#225;t, and collecting a fair number of adherents on his way, he attacked Fatesingh. <note place="margin">1774.</note>After various engagements of little importance, the latter found himself shut into the city of Baroda, which was invested by Govindr&#225;v in January 1775.

 </p><p><note place="margin">R&#225;ghob&#225; Peshwa, 1774.</note>In the meantime R&#225;ghob&#225; had been driven from power by the intrigues of Br&#225;hmans of a different class from that to which he belonged, headed by the afterwards well-known N&#225;na Phadnis. The ex-Peshwa first betook himself towards M&#225;lwa, where he hoped to be joined or at least assisted by Holkar and Sindia. As soon however as he got together some scattered forces he marched down the T&#225;pti and opened negotiations with the English through Mr. Gambier, the chief at Surat. The Bombay Government at once demanded the cession of Bassein, S&#225;lsette, and the adjacent islands. R&#225;ghob&#225; refused, partly, in all probability, on account of the pride felt by the Mar&#225;tha soldiery in their achievements before Bassein at the time of the great siege. He however offered valuable territory in Gujar&#225;t, yielding a revenue of about eleven l&#225;khs, and to pay six l&#225;khs down and 1&#189; l&#225;khs monthly for the maintenance of a European contingent with artillery. The English at Bombay were debating whether this offer should not be accepted when news reached them that the Portuguese were about to organise an expedition to re-take Bassein. Negotiations with R&#225;ghob&#225; were hastily broken off and a small force sent to forestall the rival Europeans. Before the end of 1774, both Th&#225;na and Versova fort in S&#225;lsette had been taken.

 </p><p><note place="margin">R&#225;ghob&#225; in Gujar&#225;t, 1775.</note>R&#225;ghob&#225; now heard that Sindia and Holkar had been bought over by the ministerial party and would not come to his assistance. <pb id="pb402" n="402"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item></list> </fw>Quickly moving his force down the river he reached Baroda in January 1775 with 10,000 horse and 400 foot. He joined Govindr&#225;v in investing that town, but sent meanwhile an agent to re-open the discussion of his proposals in the Bombay Council. This agent was captured by a party of Fatesingh&#8217;s horse whilst he was out on an expedition near P&#225;rnera on behalf of Govindr&#225;v. On his release he repaired to Surat and took steps to get a treaty of alliance signed as soon as possible.

 </p><p><note place="margin">R&#225;ghob&#225; Defeated.</note>The ministerial army of 30,000 men under Haripant Phadke entered Gujar&#225;t and obliged Govindr&#225;v and R&#225;ghob&#225; to raise the siege of Baroda and to retire towards the Mahi. Fatesingh&#8217;s force then joined Haripant. An attack on all sides was made (Feb. 17th). R&#225;ghob&#225;, who was in the centre, was first charged, and before Govindr&#225;v and Khander&#225;v G&#225;ikw&#225;r could come to his assistance his best officers were wounded, some of his Arab mercenaries refused to fight as large arrears of pay were due to them, and he was defeated on both flanks. He fled to Cambay with only 1000 horse; whilst the two G&#225;ikw&#225;rs and Man&#225;ji Sindia (Phadke) led the rest of the scattered army to Kapadvanj, where it was again set in order. The Naw&#225;b of Cambay, fearing lest the Mar&#225;tha army should come in pursuit, shut the town gates on the fugitive and refused to give him shelter. <note place="margin">Reaches Surat.</note>Mr. Malet, chief of the English residents, who had been informed of the negotiations in progress between his Government and R&#225;ghob&#225;, contrived to get the ex-Peshwa conveyed privately to Bh&#225;vnagar and from thence by boat to Surat. Here he arrived on February 23rd.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Treaty of Surat, 1775.</note>The stipulations of the treaty negotiated by Narotamd&#225;s, agent of R&#225;ghob&#225;, and the Bombay Government were: The English to provide a force of 3000 men, of which 800 were to be Europeans and 1700 natives, together with a due proportion of artillery. In return for this R&#225;ghob&#225;, still recognized as Peshwa, was to cede in perpetuity S&#225;lsette, Bassein and the islands, <corr sic="J&#225;mbusar">Jambusar</corr>, and Olp&#225;d. He also made over an assignment of <abbr>Rs.</abbr> 75,000 out of the revenues of Anklesvar, the remaining portion of which district, together with &#193;mod, H&#225;nsot, and Bals&#225;r was placed under British management as security for the monthly contribution of 1&#189; l&#225;khs for the support of the troops in his service. He also promised to procure the cession of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s share in the revenues of Broach. Sundry other provisions (dealing with different parts of the Mar&#225;tha dominions) were inserted, R&#225;ghob&#225; being treated throughout as the representative of the Mar&#225;tha kingdom. This treaty was signed on March 6th, 1775, at Surat, but on the previous day there had been a debate in the Council at Bombay as to the propriety of continuing to support R&#225;ghob&#225;, as the news from Gujar&#225;t made the British authorities doubtful whether the contingent they had already sent to Surat was enough to ensure success.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Colonel Keating in Gujar&#225;t.</note>Just before the treaty was drawn up, at the end of February Lieut.-Colonel Keating had been despatched in command of 350 European infantry 800 sepoys 80 European artillerymen and 60 gun lascars with others, in all about 1500 men, ready for active service. This force landed at Surat four days after R&#225;ghob&#225; had arrived from Bh&#225;vnagar. <pb id="pb403" n="403"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item></list> </fw>Before receiving this token of the intention of the British to support R&#225;ghob&#225;, the Naw&#225;b had treated the latter simply as a fugitive, but upon finding that the Bombay Government had determined to make the ex-Peshwa their ally, he paid the customary visits and offered presents as to a superior.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Keating Sails with R&#225;ghob&#225; for Cambay.</note>When the news reached Surat that Govindr&#225;v&#8217;s troops and the rest had been reorganized at Kapadvanj, it was determined to effect a junction with them by landing Colonel Keating&#8217;s detachment at Cambay and from thence marching north.

 </p><p><note place="margin">R&#225;ghob&#225; in Cambay, 1775.</note>Considerable delay occurred in carrying out the first part of this proposal. First of all R&#225;ghob&#225; detained the army at Dumas<note id="n403.1" n="1">At the mouth of the T&#225;pti, now belonging to the little Muhammadan state of Sachin.</note> whilst he paid a visit of ceremony to the frequented temple of Bhimpor in the neighbourhood. Then again, the convoy met with contrary winds the whole way up the gulf, and it was not till March 17th that the contingent landed. The Naw&#225;b, accompanied by the British Resident, paid a visit of ceremony and presented <hi>nazar&#225;n&#225;s</hi> to R&#225;ghob&#225; as a sort of atonement for his previous discourtesy and neglect. The Mar&#225;th&#225;s, however, knowing that this change of tone was entirely due to the presence and alliance of the Europeans, paid much more attention to the latter than to the Muhammadans.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Govindr&#225;v G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s Army.</note>The British contingent encamped at a place called N&#225;r&#225;yan-Sarovar, just north of the town. Here they waited until the reinforcement from Bombay arrived, bringing the whole force up to the complement stipulated for in the treaty. R&#225;ghob&#225;&#8217;s army under Govindr&#225;v G&#225;ikw&#225;r was reported to be moving southwards, and Colonel Keating agreed to let it pass the S&#225;barmati river before joining it. Meanwhile the enemy, said to number 40,000 infantry and 12,000 cavalry, marched north to intercept Govindr&#225;v. The latter, however, by forced marches succeeded in crossing the S&#225;barmati before the arrival of the ministerial army, and encamped a few miles north-east of Cambay at a place called Darmaj or Dara. Here Colonel Keating joined him about the middle of April.

 </p><p>Govindr&#225;v&#8217;s army consisted of about 8000 fighting men and nearly 18,000 camp followers. These latter were chiefly Pindh&#225;ris who used to attach themselves to the camp of one of the Mar&#225;tha chiefs, on condition of surrendering to him half their plunder. Each chief had his separate encampment, where he exercised independent authority over his own troops, although bound to general obedience to the commander-in-chief of the whole army. The confusion of this arrangement is described by an eye-witness as utterly destructive of all military discipline. To add to the cumbrousness of such an expedition, most of the Pindh&#225;ris brought their wives and children with them, the cooking pots and plunder being carried on bullocks and ponies, of which there were altogether nearly 200,000 attached to the troops. In every camp there was a regular <pb id="pb404" n="404"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item></list> </fw><hi>baz&#225;r</hi> where cash payment or barter passed equally current, so that a premium was thus placed on the pilfering of small articles by the Pindh&#225;ris, whose stipulations as to plunder were confined neither to friend nor enemy.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Advance of the Combined Forces.</note>When all needful preparations had been made, the army, accompanied by a battery of ten guns, besides mortars and howitzers, all of which were manned by Europeans, moved out against the enemy. The latter slowly retreated, burning the crops and forage and destroying the water-supply on its way. On the 20th April the first engagement took place at Us&#225;mli, resulting in the repulse of the ministerial troops. On May 1st a similar skirmish on the banks of the V&#225;trak drove the ministerialists into Kaira. From this post they were driven after a series of slight engagements with the army of R&#225;ghob&#225;, which crossed the river at M&#225;tar. Fatesingh now received a reinforcement of 10,000 horse under Khander&#225;v G&#225;ikw&#225;r, but to counterbalance this aid, Sindia and Holkar from some unexplained cause, connected probably with intrigues at Poona, withdrew from further co-operation with him. Colonel Keating was unable to follow up the advantages he had gained owing to the large proportion of cavalry in the enemy&#8217;s army. He therefore continued his march southwards, after persuading R&#225;ghoba to spend the monsoon in Poona, where he would be on the spot to counteract intrigues, instead of at Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d, as had been at first proposed.

 </p><p>On May 8th the army reached Na&#7693;i&#225;d, after repulsing on the road two attacks by the enemy&#8217;s cavalry. This result was obtained chiefly by means of the European light artillery. Na&#7693;i&#225;d belonged at this time to Khander&#225;v G&#225;ikw&#225;r, and to punish his defection to Fatesingh, R&#225;ghob&#225; inflicted a fine of 60,000 rupees on the town. The amount was assessed on the several castes in proportion to their reputed means of payment. The Bh&#225;ts, a peculiar people of whom more hereafter, objected to being assessed, and slaughtered each other in public: so that the guilt of their blood might fall on the oppressor. The Br&#225;hmans, who also claimed exemption from all taxation, more astutely brought two old women of their caste into the market place and there murdered them. Having made this protest, both castes paid their contributions. R&#225;ghob&#225; injudiciously wasted seven days over the collection of this fine, and in the end only levied 40,000 rupees.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Defeat of Fatesingh, 1775.</note>On May 14th the march was resumed, under the usual skirmishing onslaughts of the ministerial party. At Ar&#225;s, where R&#225;ghob&#225; had been defeated shortly before, he was in imminent danger of a second and still more serious discomfiture. An order mistaken by a British company, and the want of discipline on the part of R&#225;ghob&#225;&#8217;s cavalry nearly led to a total defeat with great slaughter. The European infantry and artillery, however, turned the fortunes of the day. The troops of Fatesingh were allowed to approach in pursuit to within a few yards of the batteries, all the guns of which then opened on them with grape, the infantry meanwhile plying their small arms along the whole line. Fatesingh was obliged to withdraw his diminished forces and the army of R&#225;ghob&#225; received no further molestations <pb id="pb405" n="405"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item></list> </fw>from him on its way to the Mahi. Colonel Keating then ordered a general move to Broach, where he arrived safely on 27th May, after a troublesome march through the robber-infested country between the Dh&#225;dhar river and &#193;mod.

 </p><p><note place="margin">The Ministerial General Retreats.</note>Here they remained until June 8th, when Colonel Keating was about to move south again. Luckily, as it turned out for him, the nearest ford was impassable and he had to march to one higher up at a place variously called B&#225;ba Pi&#225;ra or B&#225;va Pir. On his way thither he heard that Haripant, the ministerial commander-in-chief, was halting on the north bank by the ford; he therefore pushed on to make an attack on the rear, but owing partly to timely information received and partly to the confusion caused by the irrepressibility of R&#225;ghob&#225;&#8217;s cavalry, Haripant had time to withdraw all his force except some <corr sic="bagage">baggage</corr> and ammunition, which, with a few guns, he was forced in the hurry of his passage across the river to leave behind. <note place="margin">Colonel Keating at Dabhoi, 1775.</note>Colonel Keating then marched fourteen miles north from the ford and halted before proceeding to Dabhoi, a town belonging to Fatesingh. The general ignorance of tactics and want of discipline in the native army had determined Colonel Keating not to lead his force as far as Poona, but to spend the monsoon near Baroda.

 </p><p>R&#225;ghob&#225; detached one of his generals, Amir Kh&#225;n, in pursuit of Ganeshpant, whom Hari Pant had left as his deputy in Gujar&#225;t. Ganeshpant with a detachment of the ministerial army had separated from Hari at the B&#225;ba Pi&#225;ra ford and found his way through the wild country on the north of the T&#225;pti towards Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d. He was finally caught by Amir Kh&#225;n.

 </p><p>Dabhoi was at this time in charge of a Br&#225;hman governor, who submitted on the approach of R&#225;ghob&#225;&#8217;s army. Colonel Keating quartered his force in the town, but R&#225;ghob&#225;, after exacting a levy of three l&#225;khs of rupees, encamped at Bhil&#225;pur on the Dh&#225;dhar, ten miles from Dabhoi. Here he began to negotiate with Fatesingh in Baroda through the mediation of Colonel Keating. Fatesingh was all the more ready to come to definite terms of agreement, as he knew that Govindr&#225;v was on the watch to recover Baroda.

 </p><p><note place="margin">R&#225;ghob&#225; and the G&#225;ikw&#225;rs.</note>It is not certain what the terms proposed and agreed to really were. The only record of them is a copy sent in 1802 to the Resident at Poona by Governor Duncan. According to this document Govindr&#225;v was to lose his pension and to occupy the same position as before the accession of R&#225;ghob&#225;. Khander&#225;v was to revert to the situation in which he had been placed by D&#225;m&#225;ji. The provision of the treaty of the 6th March regarding the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s claims on Broach was ratified, and as a reward for the mediation of the Bombay Government, the G&#225;ikw&#225;r ceded to the British in perpetuity the sub-divisions of Chikhli and Vari&#225;v near Surat and Koral on the Narbada. Before this treaty could be concluded, Colonel Keating received orders to withdraw his contingent into British territory and to leave R&#225;ghob&#225; to manage for himself. This change of policy was due to the disapproval by the Supreme Government of the treaty of 6th March, which they alleged had been <pb id="pb406" n="406"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item></list> </fw>made inconsistently with the negotiations then being carried on with the ruling powers at Poona as well as with the authority of the Calcutta Government. The treaty was therefore declared to be invalid and the troops in the field were ordered by the Supreme Government to be withdrawn at once into British garrisons. A special envoy, Colonel Upton, was sent from Bengal to negotiate a treaty with the Ministers in accordance with the views current in Calcutta.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Withdrawal of the British Contingent.</note>As soon as the roads were open Colonel Keating moved towards Surat, but at the solicitation of R&#225;ghob&#225; he disobeyed his orders so far as to encamp at Kadod, about twenty miles east of Surat, but not in British territory. Here he awaited the results of the overtures of Colonel Upton. This envoy remained at Poona from the 28th December 1775 till the 1st March 1776, on which date <note place="margin">Negotiations at Poona.</note>he signed the treaty of Purandhar, in which the office only and not the name of the Peshwa is mentioned. By this compact the Peshwa ceded all claims on the revenue of Broach together with land in the neighbourhood of that town to the British. He also paid twelve l&#225;khs of rupees in compensation for the expenses of the war. S&#225;lsette was to be either retained by the English or restored in exchange for territory yielding three l&#225;khs of rupees annually. The cessions made by Fatesingh G&#225;ikw&#225;r were to be restored to him if the Peshwa&#8217;s Government could prove that he had no right to make them without due authorization from Poona. The treaty of the 6th March was declared null and void. R&#225;ghob&#225; was to disband his army and take a pension. If he resisted, the English were to give him no assistance. If he agreed to the terms proposed, he was to live at Kopargaon<note id="n406.1" n="1">Now in the Ahmednagar district.</note> on the God&#225;vari with an ample pension. When he received information as to the terms of the new treaty, he at once declined to accept the pension, and, as he could not understand the position of the Bombay Government with regard to that at Calcutta, he proceeded to offer still more favourable terms for further assistance.

 </p><p><note place="margin">R&#225;ghob&#225; at Surat, 1776.</note>R&#225;ghob&#225; was at M&#225;ndvi<note id="n406.2" n="2">In the Surat district <corr sic="ome">some</corr> thirty miles east of the city.</note> on the T&#225;pti when he was finally given to understand that the British could no longer aid him. He thereupon took refuge in Surat with two hundred followers. The rest of his army which had been ordered to disperse, gathered round Surat, on pretence of waiting for the payment of the arrears due to them. As their attitude was suspicious, and there were rumours of an expedition having started from Poona under Haripant to subdue them, the Bombay Government garrisoned Surat and Broach with all the forces it could spare.

 </p><p>Colonel Upton meanwhile offered R&#225;ghob&#225;, on behalf of the ministers, a larger pension with liberty of residing at <corr sic="Ben&#225;res">Benares</corr>. This also was declined, and the ex-Peshwa fled to Bombay, where he lived on a monthly pension allotted him by the Government.

At first the Bombay Government were inclined to take this as authorizing the retention of all the territory ceded, but on further deliberation it was decided that as the treaty of Purandhar had been ratified by the Supreme Government subsequent to the signing of the despatch, which was dated 5th April 1776, it was evident that the Court of Directors did not mean to uphold the previous engagement more than temporarily, or until the final treaty had been concluded.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Negotiations at Poona, 1777.</note>At the end of 1776, a Bombay officer was sent in place of Colonel Upton to be a resident envoy at Poona for the carrying out of the provisions of the treaty. Mr. Mostyn was the person selected, and he arrived in Poona in March 1777. He soon found that the ministers had little intention of adhering to the treaty, so he at once took up the question that he thought it most important to the Bombay Government to have settled, namely the relations of the Peshwa&#8217;s Court with Fatesingh G&#225;ikw&#225;r as regards the cessions of territory. The ministers asserted that the G&#225;ikw&#225;rs merely administered Gujar&#225;t on the part of the Peshwa and were entirely dependent upon the Poona government, so that they could conclude no agreement with foreign states except with its approbation. Fatesingh did not deny the dependence, but evaded the question of his right to make direct treaties and claimed the restitution of the cessions on the ground that Raghun&#225;thr&#225;v had failed to perform his part of the stipulations. The point was discussed for some time, and at last the question of dependence seems to have been let drop, for in February 1778 Fatesingh paid up the arrears of tribute, made the usual presents to the ministers and their favourites, and was again invested with the title of Sen&#225;-Kh&#225;s-Khel.

 </p><p>In October a despatch from the Court of Directors reached the Governments of Bengal and Bombay, disapproving of the treaty of Purandhar, but ratifying it on the principle <hi>factum valet</hi>. It was suggested, however, that in case of evasion on the part of the ministers, a fresh treaty should be concluded with R&#225;ghob&#225; on the lines of that of 1775.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Fresh Alliance with R&#225;ghob&#225;, 1778.</note>In November 1778 it was rumoured that the ministers in Poona were intriguing with the French, so the Bombay Government took this opportunity of entering into a treaty with R&#225;ghob&#225;, who was still in Bombay. He confirmed the grants of 1775, and as security for the pay of the British contingent that was to help in placing him on the Peshwa&#8217;s throne in Poona, he agreed to assign the revenues of Bals&#225;r and the remainder of Anklesvar, as he had done before. He stipulated, however, that his own agents should collect the dues from these districts, and that the British should take charge of them only in case of the full sum due not being paid and then merely as a temporary measure.

 </p><p><note place="margin">The Convention of Bhadgaon, 1779.</note>On the 22nd November 1778 the force moved out of Bombay, and by dint of mismanagement and internal dissension the campaign was brought to an end by the convention of the 16th January 1779. <pb id="pb408" n="408"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item></list> </fw>Under this agreement all possessions in Gujar&#225;t acquired since the time of M&#225;dhavr&#225;v Peshwa were to be restored by the British, together with S&#225;lsette, Uran, and other islands. R&#225;ghob&#225; was to be made over to Sindia&#8217;s charge, and a separate treaty assigned to Sindia the sovereignty of Broach.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Negotiation with the G&#225;ikw&#225;r.</note>The Council at Bombay disavowed the convention and were inclined to adhere only to the clause allotting Broach to Sindia. Mr. Hornby proposed to the Supreme Government an alliance with Fatesingh, engaging to free him from dependence on the Poona Government and to reconcile the disputants within the G&#225;ikw&#225;r family itself. After the arrival of General Goddard with reinforcements from Bengal the Governor General approved of the alliance proposed with Fatesingh as head of the Baroda state, but specially declined to admit any participation or support in the family disputes. The British were to conquer for themselves the Peshwa&#8217;s share of Gujar&#225;t, if they were able to do so.

 </p><p><note place="margin">R&#225;ghob&#225; Escapes from Sindia, 1779.</note>R&#225;ghob&#225;, meanwhile, who had been given over to Sindia to be conveyed to Bundelkhand, escaped with the connivance of his custodian and fled to Broach. This was evidently a move calculated by Sindia to bring on hostilities between N&#225;na Phadnis, the head of the ministerial party, and the English. General Goddard, who was conducting the negotiations with Poona on the part both of the Supreme Government and of the Government of Bombay, received R&#225;ghob&#225; on June 12th, but evaded any proposals for a direct alliance. At the end of the rains of the same year, information was received by the English that a coalition against them had been <note place="margin">League against the English, 1780.</note>formed by the Mar&#225;th&#225;s, the Niz&#225;m, and Hyder Ali of Mysor. The rumour was partially confirmed by the demand by N&#225;na Phadnis for the cession of S&#225;lsette and the person of R&#225;ghob&#225; as preliminaries to any treaty. No answer was given, but reinforcements were called for and the overtures with Fatesingh pushed forward. This chief prevaricated about the terms of the treaty and evidently did not like to enter into any special engagement that might perhaps bring down upon him the Poona army. General Goddard therefore advanced on 1st January 1780 against Dabhoi, which was garrisoned by the Peshwa&#8217;s troops from the Dakhan, whilst the English in Broach expelled the Mar&#225;tha officers from their posts and re-took possession of Anklesvar, H&#225;nsot, and &#193;mod. On January 20th Dabhoi was evacuated by the Mar&#225;th&#225;s and occupied by General Goddard. Fatesingh now showed himself willing to enter into the proposed treaty, and on the 26th January 1780 signed an offensive and defensive alliance.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Treaty with Fatesingh G&#225;ikw&#225;r.</note>In the re-opening of hostilities there was no mention of R&#225;ghob&#225;, but the ground given was simply the non-fulfilment on the part of the Peshwa of his treaty engagement. R&#225;ghob&#225; remained under English supervision in the enjoyment of a large allowance. Dabhoi was occupied by an English civil officer with a detachment of irregulars, and General Goddard moved towards Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d.

To avoid confusion in collection, the district north of the Mahi was to belong entirely to the share of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r. The English were to enjoy the whole district south of the T&#225;pti, together with the G&#225;ikw&#225;r share in the revenue of Surat. In return for the support the English were to give him in withholding tribute <corr sic="fron">from</corr> the Peshwa, <corr sic="Fatesing">Fatesingh</corr> ceded Sinor on the Narbada and the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s villages round Broach. These cessions, however, were not to have effect until Fatesingh was in possession of Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d. The contingent of 3000 horse was to be still furnished by the G&#225;ikw&#225;r government.

 </p><p><note place="margin">General Goddard takes Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d, 1780.</note>As soon as these conditions were agreed upon, General Goddard went with his own army and the contingent furnished by Fatesingh to Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d. After encamping before it for five days, he took the city by storm on 15th February 1780.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Operations against Sindia and Holkar.</note>Sindia and Holkar had combined their forces against the English and were marching up Gujar&#225;t, plundering on their way. They were opposed by General Goddard, who marched across the Mahi early in March. The allies turned off towards Ch&#225;mp&#225;ner without risking a pitched battle on the plain. Sindia at once opened negotiations with the view of wasting time during the fair season. His first proposal was that R&#225;ghob&#225; should be sent to Jh&#225;nsi, where Sindia had allotted him an estate, and that B&#225;jir&#225;v, R&#225;ghob&#225;&#8217;s son, should be appointed <hi>div&#225;n</hi> or manager of the Peshwa <corr sic="Madh&#225;vr&#225;v">M&#225;dhavr&#225;v</corr>, who was a minor. B&#225;jir&#225;v himself was under age, so Sindia was, of course, to assume temporarily the reins of government.

 </p><p>Goddard at once refused to force R&#225;ghob&#225; to take any course other than the one he should select of his own free will; for Sindia did not appear to be aware that the English were now at war with the ministers on their own account and not as allies of an ex-Peshwa. Negotiations were broken off and Sindia and Holkar dislodged from place after place without any decisive engagement being fought. General Goddard was preparing monsoon quarters for his army, when he heard that a division of a Mar&#225;tha force which had been plundering the Konkan in order to cut off supplies from Bombay had attacked parts of the Surat Ath&#225;visi. He detached some troops under Lieut. Welsh and sent them to the south, whilst he remained himself on the Narbada. Lieut. Welsh drove back the marauders and took possession of the forts of P&#225;rnera, Indargad, and Bagv&#225;da.

 </p><p>After the monsoon of 1780, General Goddard went to besiege Bassein, leaving Major Forbes in charge of the Gujar&#225;t army. This officer posted one body of troops at Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d for the protection of Fatesingh, another at Surat, and a third at Broach. Two battalions of Bengal infantry were sent to Sinor and some few men to Dabhoi.

 </p><p><note place="margin">1781.</note>An attack was made by Sindia on the newly acquired district of Sinor, but Major Forbes successfully resisted it and Sindia&#8217;s position with regard to his own dominions was now such as to prevent him from sending more expeditions against Gujar&#225;t.

 </p><p>The military necessities of other parts of India were such as to induce General Goddard to apply to Fatesingh for an increase to <pb id="pb410" n="410"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item></list> </fw>his contingent, in accordance with the treaty of 1780. After some personal communications with this Chief in Gujar&#225;t, General Goddard was able to arrange with the G&#225;ikw&#225;r for the defence of part of that province and thus set free some European troops for service elsewhere.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Treaty of S&#225;lbai, 1782.</note>No further attack was made in this direction during the continuance of the war which came to an end on 17th May 1782. The treaty of S&#225;lbai between an envoy of the Governor General on one side and Mah&#225;d&#225;ji Sindia as plenipotentiary for the Peshwa and minister of Poona on the other, replaced the Mar&#225;tha territory in Gujar&#225;t exactly where it was on the outbreak of hostilities against R&#225;ghob&#225; in 1775. It was, however, specially stipulated that no demand for arrears of tribute during the late hostilities should be made against the G&#225;ikw&#225;r, a clause that led to misunderstandings many years later. The town of Broach was given over to Sindia in accordance with the secret negotiation of 1779 and the votes of the Bengal and Bombay Councils. The territory round Broach yielding a revenue of three l&#225;khs of rupees, ceded by the Peshwa, was likewise returned. R&#225;ghob&#225; was granted a pension of 25,000 rupees a month and allowed to select his own place of residence. He went to Kopargaon and there died a few months after the conclusion of the treaty of S&#225;lbai. Thus came to an end one of the chief sources of disturbance to the Poona government. For the next six years no event of any political importance took place in Gujar&#225;t, which province was left almost entirely to the administration of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r family.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Death of Fatesingh, 1789.</note>In 1789, however, Fatesingh died, leaving Say&#225;jir&#225;v without a guardian. M&#225;n&#225;ji, a younger brother, at once seized the reins of government and began the usual sort of negotiations to secure his recognition by the Poona government. He paid a nazar&#225;na of 3,13,000 rupees and agreed to pay up thirty-six l&#225;khs of rupees as arrears, though it is not clear on what account, unless that sum had accrued since the treaty of S&#225;lbai, or was part of the long standing account left open by D&#225;m&#225;ji in 1753. M&#225;n&#225;ji, however, was not allowed to succeed to the post of guardian without opposition. Govindr&#225;v G&#225;ikw&#225;r was living at Poona, and, though he had himself little influence with the Peshwa&#8217;s immediate adherents, he had managed to secure the then powerful Sindia on his side. This chief, since his recognition as plenipotentiary at the treaty of S&#225;lbai, had been gradually making good his position with the Peshwa and his favourites as well as with the leading Mar&#225;tha nobles, so as to be able to successfully oppose N&#225;na Phadnis when the time came for a coalition of the outlying chiefs against the ministerial party. Govindr&#225;v offered his son &#193;nandr&#225;v as husband for the daughter of Sindia, a proposal which it is not probable that he ever intended to carry out. A grant of three l&#225;khs of rupees was also promised, in return for which Sindia allowed his garrison in Broach to assist Govindr&#225;v&#8217;s illegitimate son K&#225;nhoji to reach Baroda. M&#225;n&#225;ji applied to the Bombay Government on the grounds that the steps taken by Govindr&#225;v were contrary to the provisions of the treaty of 1780. As however this treaty had been abrogated by the later agreement at S&#225;lbai, the Bombay Government declined to interfere. M&#225;n&#225;ji&#8217;s agents at Poona <pb id="pb411" n="411"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item></list> </fw>contrived to get N&#225;na Phadnis to propose a compromise, to which however Govindr&#225;v, at the instigation probably of Sindia, declined to accede. Before any decision was reached M&#225;n&#225;ji died.

 </p><p><note place="margin">1793.</note>N&#225;na detained Govindr&#225;v in Poona till he had agreed to hold by former stipulations and to cede to the Peshwa the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s share in the districts south of the T&#225;pti together with his share of the Surat customs. To this the Government of Bombay demurred as an infraction of the provision of the S&#225;lbai treaty whereby the integrity of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s possessions was assured. N&#225;na Phadnis at once withdrew his proposals. Govindr&#225;v at last joined his brother at Baroda on 19th December, and took up the office of regent.

 </p><p><note place="margin">&#193;ba Shelukar Deputy Governor of Gujar&#225;t, 1796.</note>For two years Gujar&#225;t remained quiet. In 1796 B&#225;jir&#225;v, son of R&#225;ghob&#225;, <corr sic="suceeded">succeeded</corr> to the Peshwa&#8217;s dignity and at once appointed his younger brother, ten years of age, governor of Gujar&#225;t. In accordance with Mar&#225;tha custom a deputy was sent to take charge of the province, one &#193;ba Shelukar, and he too seems to have administered vicariously, for next year (1797) we find him amongst those taken prisoners with N&#225;na Phadnis when that minister was treacherously seized by <corr sic="Daulatrav">Daulatr&#225;v</corr> Sindia in the Dakhan. &#193;ba was released on promising to pay ten l&#225;khs of rupees as ransom. <note place="margin">1797.</note>He then joined his appointment as subhed&#225;r in order to take measures to get together the money he required.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Disputes between &#193;ba and Govindr&#225;v G&#225;ikw&#225;r.</note>B&#225;jir&#225;v Peshwa was anxious to embroil &#193;ba with Govindr&#225;v, whom he knew to be favourable to N&#225;na Phadnis and too powerful to be allowed to acquire influence beyond the reach of head-quarter supervision. A cause of quarrel soon arose. Daulatr&#225;v pressed &#193;ba for part payment of the above ten l&#225;khs, and the latter being unable to squeeze enough out of his own territory, forced contributions from some of the villages administered by the G&#225;ikw&#225;r. Govindr&#225;v at once took up arms against him and applied for aid to the English Agent at Surat. In this city Governor Jonathan Duncan had just assumed chief authority in accordance with an agreement between the English and the Naw&#225;b. Duncan was anxious to secure for his government the land round Surat and the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s share in the <hi>chauth</hi> of the town and district. Govindr&#225;v, when this demand was made, referred the Governor to Poona, knowing that under the treaty of S&#225;lbai the British Government had no more right to acquire a share of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r territory than the Poona authorities had when they made a somewhat similar demand in 1793, which was withdrawn as stated above. Before the reference could be made, &#193;ba was penned up by Govindr&#225;v&#8217;s own army in Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d and forced to surrender that city. He was kept in confinement for more than seven years.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Gujar&#225;t farmed to the G&#225;ikw&#225;r, 1799.</note>In the same year (1799) the Peshwa, apparently without formally revoking the appointment of his brother Chimn&#225;ji as Subhed&#225;r, gave Govindr&#225;v a farm for five years of his whole rights in Gujar&#225;t, at the rate of five l&#225;khs of rupees a year. These rights included shares in the K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a and Sorath tribute, the revenue of Petl&#225;d, N&#225;p&#225;d, R&#225;npur, Dhandhuka, and Gogha, together with rights to certain customs dues in Cambay and a share in the revenue of the city of Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d. <pb id="pb412" n="412"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item></list> </fw>Govindr&#225;v unfortunately died a month before this farm was formally made over by the Peshwa.

The disputes as to the guardianship again set the whole state in confusion. K&#225;nhoji, a son of Govindr&#225;v by a R&#225;jputni princess of Dharampor, who had been the first agent of his father in Baroda in 1793, had been put in prison for refusing to give place to Govindr&#225;v when the latter at length joined him at Baroda. At the death of Govindr&#225;v, K&#225;nhoji managed to obtain his liberty and to secure the ascendancy in the counsels of his weak-minded elder brother. He assumed, in fact, the whole government. His arrogant conduct in this new position excited the Arab guard against him and he was again thrown into confinement. His mother Gajr&#225;b&#225;i, who was a refugee in Surat, endeavoured to get assistance from the English there, and at the same time made overtures to Malh&#225;r, son of Khander&#225;v G&#225;ikw&#225;r, who had formerly been one of Govindr&#225;v&#8217;s bitterest opponents.

 </p><p><note place="margin">1800.</note>Meanwhile the administration of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s affairs passed into the hands of R&#225;vji and B&#225;b&#225;ji &#193;ppa, two brothers who had been brought to Baroda in 1793 by Govindr&#225;v himself. R&#225;vji took charge of the civil work, whilst B&#225;b&#225;ji undertook the military duties, which at that time consisted in great measure in collecting the revenue by show of force. These two ministers, on hearing of the proceedings of <note place="margin">The British aid Govindr&#225;v&#8217;s Party.</note>Gajr&#225;b&#225;i, outbid her for the aid of the Bombay Government. In addition to the cessions formerly offered by Govindr&#225;v, they were willing to give up Chikhli also. Matters were precipitated by the successes of Malh&#225;r&#225;v in the field. R&#225;vji offered to subsidize five European battalions, and Governor Duncan took upon himself the responsibility of sending an auxiliary force of 1600 men under Major Walker to act with the troops of R&#225;vji and B&#225;b&#225;ji north of Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d. Reinforcements were afterwards sent up, but the campaign was not closed till April 1802, when the fort of Kadi had been taken by storm. Malh&#225;r&#225;v surrendered and a residence in <corr sic="Na&#7693;iad">Na&#7693;i&#225;d</corr> was assigned him with a liberal pension out of the revenues of that sub-division. The fort of Sankheda, which had been held by Ganpatr&#225;v G&#225;ikw&#225;r for his cousin Malh&#225;r&#225;v, was soon after this reduced and the country for a time pacified.

 </p><p><note place="margin">The British and the G&#225;ikw&#225;r, 1800.</note>In March R&#225;vji had an interview at Cambay with Governor Duncan, which was followed on June 6th by a definite treaty, of which the groundwork had been previously sketched in anticipation of the reduction of the revolted G&#225;ikw&#225;rs. Two thousand men, besides artillery, were to be subsidized and a <hi>j&#225;id&#225;d</hi> or assignment for their payment was made on the revenue of Dholka and the part of Na&#7693;i&#225;d not assigned to Malh&#225;rr&#225;v. Chikhli was given to the British in reward for their aid in storming Kadi, and Residents were to be appointed reciprocally. A large sum of money was borrowed by R&#225;vji, partly from Bombay partly from Baroda bankers, to pay off the arrears due to about 7000 Arab mercenaries, who had usurped a great deal of objectionable influence in civil affairs at the <corr sic="G&#225;ikwar&#8217;s">G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s</corr> <pb id="pb413" n="413"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item></list> </fw>capital.

It was deemed advisable by the British Government to have at the Baroda court some leading personage who might, in the present state of the relations between Bombay and Poona, further the designs of the former government in preventing a recurrence of the coalition of Mar&#225;tha powers. R&#225;vji was sure of his reward if he served British interests, whilst in case of the reorganization of a Mar&#225;tha confederacy the state he was administering would probably play but a very subordinate part in subsequent events.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Treaty of Bassein, 31st Dec. 1802.</note>The treaty of June 6th was disapproved by the Court of Directors as being in direct contravention of the treaty of S&#225;lbai.

By this treaty the Peshwa virtually placed his independence in the hands of the British. He ceded his share of Surat, thus giving them sole control over that district. In payment of the subsidiary force required he handed over territory in Gujar&#225;t, the revenue of which amounted to 12,28,000 rupees, and finally he constituted the British Government arbiter in the disputes between his government and that of Baroda. The grants made by the G&#225;ikw&#225;r for the support of the subsidiary force amounted in 1802 to 7,80,000 rupees.

K&#225;nhoji was not subdued till February 1803. <note place="margin">Malh&#225;rr&#225;v in Revolt, 1803.</note>Malh&#225;rr&#225;v meanwhile had broken out in rebellion in <corr sic="K&#225;thi&#225;va&#7693;a">K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a</corr> and was plundering the Mar&#225;tha possessions there. B&#225;b&#225;ji &#193;pp&#225;ji and a young officer named Vithal Dev&#225;ji (or Div&#225;nji) led the operations against him; and to the latter belongs the honour of having captured this troublesome member of the ruling family. The estate of Na&#7693;i&#225;d, which had been assigned to Madhavr&#225;o by Govindr&#225;v, was resumed by R&#225;vji &#193;pp&#225;ji and made over in its entirety to the British Government. A treaty, supplementary to that of 1802, was drawn up guaranteeing this cession as well as the <hi>in&#225;m</hi> or free gift of the fort and district of Kaira, &#8220;out of gratitude for the support given in the recent troubles to the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s honour and for assistance in securing the good of the State.&#8221;

Not long after, the war that had been some time imminent broke out, and a contingent of 7352 men from Gujar&#225;t was ordered to the field.

By this means one of the rising Mar&#225;tha powers was extruded from the centre to the outlying portion of the province. The employment of all the British contingent against Sindia&#8217;s possessions in Gujar&#225;t precluded Major Walker from furnishing any portion of the army that was annually sent to collect the tribute in <corr sic="K&#225;thi&#225;va&#7693;a">K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a</corr>. R&#225;vji &#193;pp&#225;ji had expressly stipulated that some part of the contingent might be so used when it could be spared from its main duties. The Supreme Government agreed to the proposal when made by Governor Duncan, on the grounds of the advantage both to the G&#225;ikw&#225;r and the tributaries of employing on this disagreeable duty a strong and well-disciplined force. Already some of the tributaries had made overtures to Major Walker with a view to obtaining British protection against powerful neighbours. Governor Duncan was in favour of accepting the duty of protection and also of helping the <corr sic="G&#225;ikwar&#8217;s">G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s</corr> commander in his expeditions through the peninsula on these grounds. Firstly, the officer in command could exercise a certain supervision over the collections in which the British as part assignees had a direct interest. Secondly, a way could thus be opened for the acquisition of a port on the coast from which the intrigues, supposed to be carried on by agents from the Isle of France, could be watched and counteracted. From such a point, too, the views of the Bombay Government as regards Kachh could be promoted. Thirdly, the commandant could take steps to improve the system of forcible collections, and towards abolishing the barbarous features of this rude method of levying tribute. He could also, perhaps, suggest some system by which the advantages of all three parties concerned would be better secured than by reliance on the uncertainty of temporary expeditions. The fourth and last <pb id="pb415" n="415"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item></list> </fw>reason given savours strongly of the Mar&#225;tha policy of the time, of which the leading maxim was <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">Divide et impera</hi>. It was represented that B&#225;b&#225;ji, who had successfully collected the tribute during 1802&#8211;03 and whose subordinate and companion Vithal Dev&#225;ji was a person of similar energy and capability, might possibly acquire too great influence if left in a quasi-independent command at such a distance from the Court. It was politic, then, to join with the force under his command a strong foreign body, thus dividing both the power and the responsibility. The war with Sindia caused these proposals to fall into abeyance for some time.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Renewal of Farm, 1804.</note>Meanwhile the Resident at Poona was doing his best to secure for the G&#225;ikw&#225;r a further lease for ten years of the farm of the Peshwa&#8217;s dominions in Gujar&#225;t, so that the inconveniences of dual government might be avoided. In October 1804 a ten years&#8217; farm was granted in the name of Bhagvantr&#225;v G&#225;ikw&#225;r at an annual rate of 4&#189; l&#225;khs of rupees.

 </p><p><note place="margin">The British and the G&#225;ikw&#225;r, 1805.</note>This grant led to the consolidation of all previous engagements into a single treaty, which was signed in April 1805. Previous agreements were confirmed and the whole brought into consonance with the treaty of Bassein. Districts yielding 11,70,000 rupees per annum were made over for the support of the subsidiary force, and arrangements were also made for the repayment of the cash loan advanced by the British Government in 1802, when the liquidation of the arrears due to the Arabs was a matter of urgent political necessity. The British contingent was to be available in part for service in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a, whenever the British Government thought such an employment of it advisable.

 </p><p>Finally, the British Government was constituted arbiter in all disputes of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r, not alone with foreign powers, but also in the adjustment of his financial transactions with the Peshwa his paramount power. These transactions, which ranged back from the capture of D&#225;m&#225;ji in 1751, had never been the subject of a formal investigation, and were by this time complicated by the numerous engagements with third parties into which both governments had been obliged to enter at their various moments of distress. B&#225;jir&#225;v, who was apparently intriguing for a Mar&#225;tha coalition against his new protectors, was careful not to bring before the notice of the chiefs, whose esteem he wished to gain, a provision which exhibited him as in any way dependent upon the arbitration of a foreign power. He therefore granted the farm for ten years to the G&#225;ikw&#225;r, as much by way of remanding for a time the proposed inquiries and settlement of their respective claims as for the purpose of diverting the attention of the British to the administration of this new appanage, whilst leaving him free scope for his intrigues in the Dakhan. He used, moreover, every pretext to defer the consideration of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r question until he could make use of his claims to further his own designs. His success in preventing a discussion of these transactions is apparent by the fact that in the financial statement of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s affairs made by Colonel Walker in 1804, no mention of the Poona demand is to be found.

 </p><p><note place="margin">1807.</note>In 1807 the Resident made over &#193;ba Shelukar, late Sar Subhed&#225;r of the Peshwa, to the British Government, by whom he could be prevented from engaging in fresh conspiracies. After this Colonel Walker was at last enabled to leave Baroda in order to assist in the settlement of the K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a tribute question, an object he had long had in view, but which the necessity for his continuous presence at the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s capital had hitherto prevented him from undertaking.

 </p><p><note place="margin">K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a Tribute.</note>The changes with regard to the collection of the tribute from the chiefs of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a that were carried out in 1807 deserve a special description. Firstly, they placed the relations of the tributary to the paramount power on quite a new basis. Secondly, by them the British influence over both parties concerned was much increased and the connection between the governments of Bombay and Baroda drawn closer. Thirdly, they were subsequently, as will be seen hereafter, the subject of much discussion and delay in the settlement of the questions at issue between the Peshwa and the G&#225;ikw&#225;r. And lastly, their effect was most beneficial to both the chiefs and their subjects in removing the uncertainty that had hitherto pervaded the whole revenue administration of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a.

 </p><p>Before entering on the details of the settlement itself, some description is necessary of the social and political state of the peninsula at the time the changes were introduced.

 </p><p><note place="margin">State of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a, 1807.</note>The greater part of the population of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a consisted of two classes, chiefs and cultivators, called Bhumi&#225;s and ryots. The power of the chief ranged from the headship of a single village up to absolute jurisdiction over several score. The ryots were usually tenants long resident in the province. The chiefs were in almost every case foreigners, invaders from the north and north-east; Muhammadan adventurers from the court of Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d; K&#225;this animated by the love of plunder and cattle-lifting; and Mi&#225;n&#225;s and V&#225;ghel&#225;s who had settled on the coast on account of the facilities it afforded for their favourite pursuits of wrecking and piracy. More numerous than any others were the <corr sic="Rajputs">R&#225;jputs</corr>, driven south by the disturbed state of their native kingdoms or by the restless spirit of military adventure to be found in a class where one profession alone is honourable. There is a certain uniformity in the building up of all these chieftainships. A powerful leader, with a sufficient band of followers, oppressed his weaker neighbours till they were glad to come to terms and place themselves under his protection, so as both to escape themselves and to take their chance of sharing in the plunder of others. It frequently happened in the growth of one of these states that the <hi>bh&#225;y&#225;d</hi> or relations of the chief (who are sure to be numerous in a polygamous society) were influential enough to assume, in their turn, a partial independence and to claim recognition <pb id="pb417" n="417"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item><item>State of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a, 1807.</item></list> </fw>as a separate state. As a rule, however, they continued to unite with the head of the family against external foes, and only disagreed as to domestic administration. It is also noticeable that though so addicted to the profession of arms, the <corr sic="Rajputs">R&#225;jputs</corr> cannot be called a military race; they possess few of the true military virtues; hence the slowness of their advance, and their failure in competition with perhaps less courageous though more compact and pliable races. In K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a fortified strongholds, formidable enough to an army moving rapidly without siege trains, arose in all directions, and even villages were surrounded by a high mud wall as a protection against cattle-lifters.

 </p><p>The groundwork of these states being itself so unstable, their relations with each other were conducted on no principle but the law of the stronger. General distrust reigned throughout. Each chief well knew that his neighbours had won their position as he had won his own by the gradual absorption of the weaker, and that they were ready enough whenever opportunity offered to subject his dominions to the same process. The administration of his territory consisted merely in levying, within certain limits sanctioned by long usage, as much revenue as would suffice to maintain himself and his forces in their position with regard to the surrounding states. When a foreign enemy appeared there was no co-operation amongst the local chiefs in resistance. It was a point of honour not to yield except to a superior force. Each chief, therefore, resisted the demands made upon him until he considered that he had done enough to satisfy the family conscience and then, agreeing to the terms proposed, he allowed the wave of extortion to pass on and deluge the domains of his neighbour. It should be remembered that the peninsula had never been subjugated, though overrun times innumerable. The evil of invasion was thus transitory. To a chief the mere payment of tribute tended in no wise to derogate from his independence. In his capacity of military freebooter he acknowledged the principle as just. His country had been won by the sword and was retained by the sword and not by acquiescence in the payment of tribute, so that if he could avoid this extortion he was justified in doing so. If he weakened his state in resisting foreigners, he knew that his neighbours would certainly take advantage of the favourable juncture and annex his territory. It was his policy therefore, after resistance up to a certain point, to succumb.

 </p><p><note place="margin">The Revenue Raid System.</note>Owing to this local peculiarity and to the general want of union in the province, both the Mughals and Mar&#225;th&#225;s found it advantageous to follow a system of successive expeditions rather than to incur the expense of permanently occupying the peninsula with an army which would necessarily have to be a large one. There is every reason to believe that in adopting the raid system the Musalm&#225;ns were only pursuing the practice of their predecessors, who used to take tribute from Jodhpur to Dw&#225;rka.

 </p><p>Some of the subhed&#225;rs of Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d divided their tributary district into three circuits of collection and personally undertook the <pb id="pb418" n="418"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item><item>The Revenue Raid System.</item></list> </fw>charge of one each year. This was the <hi>mulakgiri</hi> <corr sic="Land-raiding">land-raiding</corr> system. Besides this chief expedition, there was the smaller one of the B&#225;bi of Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h and the still more minute operations of the R&#225;val of Bh&#225;vnagar against some of his weaker neighbours. The great Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d expedition had long been an annual grievance and was conducted with some show of system and under special rules called the <hi>Raj-ul-Mulak</hi>. Three of these rules are of importance, and seem to have been generally acquiesced in before the great incursions of B&#225;b&#225;ji and Vithalr&#225;v at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The first was that the paramount power (by which was meant the foreign government which was strong enough to enforce tribute from all the chiefs) had authority to interfere in cases of dismemberment, or in proceedings tending to the depreciation of the revenue or to the dismemberment of any tributary state. It was again an acknowledged rule that whilst the mulakgiri expedition of the paramount power was in motion no other army should be in the field throughout the whole province. The third provision was not so well established, but it appears to have been understood that the tribute from each state should be regulated by some standard of former date. In practice, however, the measure of the Mar&#225;tha demand was simply the power to enforce payment.

 </p><p>It is worthy of remark that about the beginning of this century the resistance to the collection of tribute was stronger towards the west than in the east and south of the province. In the Mahi K&#225;ntha the lawlessness of the Koli chiefs, who had established themselves in the ravines and on the hills, necessitated the employment of a military force for collections. In the neighbourhood of Bij&#225;pur and Kadi, the chiefs would not pay tribute except under the compulsion of a siege or raid, but the mulakgiri system only reached its full development west of Dholka.

 </p><p>From these explanatory remarks the system and practice of the Mar&#225;th&#225;s can be clearly understood.

 </p><p><note place="margin">The <corr sic="M&#225;r&#225;th&#225;s">Mar&#225;th&#225;s</corr> in Sorath.</note>The Mar&#225;th&#225;s found their way to Sorath very early in their Gujar&#225;t career. The first raid probably took place about 1711, when the Muhammadans were occupied near Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d. After this incursions were frequent, and under D&#225;m&#225;ji G&#225;ikw&#225;r became, as has been seen above, annual. This leader did more. He took to wife a daughter of the Gohil chief of the small state of L&#225;thi in east central K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a, whose dowry in land gave him the standpoint he sought in the heart of the peninsula. He managed also to secure his position in what are known as the Amreli Mah&#225;ls, probably under the force of circumstances similar to those which caused the weaker <corr sic="Rajputs">R&#225;jputs</corr> to gravitate towards the stronger of their own tribe. His expedition through the peninsula, generally as near the time of harvest as possible, was made regularly every year as soon as he had amassed a sufficient number of troops on the mainland to admit of a force being detached for mulakgiri. The object of these inroads was plunder, not conquest; the leaders would readily have entered into negotiations for the payment of the tribute had the chieftains been disposed to treat otherwise than after defeat. The expenses <pb id="pb419" n="419"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item><item>The Mar&#225;th&#225;s in Sorath.</item></list> </fw>of such an army were heavy, and the more so as the time during which it would be in the field was quite indefinite, and dependent entirely upon the amount of resistance offered. In more than one instance the Mar&#225;tha leaders, who usually had no artillery for a siege, were obliged to regularly beleaguer a town. Early in this century the town of M&#225;lia successfully defended itself against a remarkably well equipped force under B&#225;b&#225;ji, and the Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h state was usually avoided by the Mar&#225;th&#225;s as much as possible on account of the time it would take to reduce its army to terms.

 </p><p>It is not on record that the mulakgiri force habitually devastated the country over which it passed, or caused much greater hardships to the ryots than are inseparable from the passage of an army in the field. There are, however, well authenticated stories of the depredations and damage committed during these expeditions. A village is said to have been deserted by order of the <hi>bhumia</hi> in order that the timber of its houses might furnish fuel for the Mar&#225;tha army on its march. Tortures were doubtless inflicted on men supposed to be well off, who were suspected to have hidden their property. A Mar&#225;tha army was usually, if not always, ill disciplined, as is proved by the testimony of Mr. Forbes, an eye witness of the campaigns of 1775.<note id="n419.1" n="1">Oriental Memoirs.</note> From the same writer it is learned what an immense proportion the camp followers bore to the actual combatants. If this were the case in a real campaign against a formidable and active enemy, it is likely that the irresponsible element was still larger in an expedition like this of mulakgiri, where the enemy was insignificant and the country at the mercy of the invaders. It is probable therefore that the troops have been credited with misconduct that should in point of fact be attributed to these Pindh&#225;ris. In after years, when the expeditions were conducted systematically, villages on the line of march were always allowed the alternative of entertaining a pioneer or two as a sort of guarantee. If no <hi>bandh&#225;ri</hi> of this sort were accepted, the army occupied the place. In many cases the demands for supplies made by these pioneers were so exorbitant that the villagers preferred to compound in turn with them also for their absence. Another method by which a chieftain might avoid the necessity of the army&#8217;s passing through his territories was by sending to the commander of the expedition an envoy empowered to treat for the amount of tribute and to execute a provisional guarantee for its future liquidation. This deed was destroyed on the subsequent confirmation by the chief himself of the agreement for the sum fixed.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Securities.</note>This habit of taking securities in all engagements was so prevalent in all parts of the province, and played so prominent a part in the financial administration of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s home and tributary domains, that its main features are worth describing.

 </p><p>It is a well known characteristic of Hindu dealings that no transaction is carried on by two parties alone if a third can possibly be dragged in. This practice no doubt originated in the former insecure <pb id="pb420" n="420"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item><item>Securities.</item></list> </fw>state of society when no man considered himself safe in person or property from government on the one hand and his neighbour on the other. With classes like Kolis and predatory <corr sic="Rajputs">R&#225;jputs</corr>, the feeling is intelligible enough, and from these it spread into other branches of the society. To such a pitch was distrust carried in the early part of the nineteenth century, that the G&#225;ikw&#225;r himself could find no one to enter into a contract with him without the guarantee of one of his own subjects. The consequences of this practice and the power it threw into the hands of the Arab mercenaries, who were the principal securities for the public debts, are matters that touch the history of the Baroda State rather than that of the province. The chiefs in their dealings employed a special sort of security which owed its validity not to political consideration like that of the Arab Jam&#225;d&#225;rs but entirely to its religious and traditional character.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Bh&#225;ts and Ch&#225;rans, 1807.</note>A society of the military type like the <corr sic="Rajput">R&#225;jput</corr> has a tendency towards caste and privilege. Without a leader the warlike instincts of the tribe would not carry them beyond petty robberies; whilst with a leader they can achieve greater exploits of valour and destruction. The successful chief then is idolized, and after a certain stage the privileges of the chieftainship become hereditary. Once this system is established, the celebration of ancestors follows, and when circumstances are favourable to the perpetuation of the hereditary position, the genealogy of the chief is a matter of the highest importance, and the person entrusted with the record of this is vested with peculiar sanctity. It is the genealogist&#8217;s duty to enter in the record, not only the direct line but the names of the more distant relations of the chief by whom he is retained, and also to be the continual chanter of the glorious deeds of their common ancestors. He is therefore a referee of the highest authority in questions of pedigree or of the partition of inheritance. An injury to his person might entail the loss of the pedigree of the ruling family (especially as many of the bards kept no written record) and thus produce a misfortune which would be felt by the whole tribe. The chief, being a warrior, must take his chance in the field with the rest, but the person of the genealogist was sacred and inviolable. Amongst the <corr sic="Rajputs">R&#225;jputs</corr> the greatest reverence was paid to purity of pedigree, and each principal family had its Bh&#225;t to record births and deaths amongst its members and to stimulate pride in their lineage by the recital of the wars and exploits of their ancestors.

 </p><p>These Bh&#225;ts necessarily multiplied beyond the number of the families that could entertain them, so that many took to banking and some to cultivation. Surrounded as they were by the social system of the Hindus, it was not long before they became differentiated into a distinct caste, and the inviolability of their persons, formerly due only to respect for the pedigree, was now extended to the whole tribe, even though a large proportion of it performed none of the duties of genealogists. Similar to the Bh&#225;ts in many respects, notably in that of sacredness of person, were the Ch&#225;rans, numerous in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a, where they had founded villages and lived as ordinary <pb id="pb421" n="421"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item><item>Bh&#225;ts and Ch&#225;rans, 1807.</item></list> </fw>cultivators. This tribe also claimed divine origin like the race whose annals they had the privilege of recording. It is said that R&#225;ja Todar Mal, the celebrated minister of the Dehli empire, was the first to introduce the practice of taking these Bh&#225;ts as securities for the <corr sic="Rajputs">R&#225;jputs</corr>. The assertion is possibly true, but rests merely on tradition, and after ages usually find some great man as a sponsor for all such innovations. It is clear however that for many years before 1807 no dealings of Kolis or <corr sic="Rajputs">R&#225;jputs</corr> with the state or with each other took place without the security of a Bh&#225;t being taken. This practice seems to have been as prevalent on the mainland as in the peninsula, the Kolis having doubtless borrowed it from their <corr sic="Rajput">R&#225;jput</corr> neighbours after the Bh&#225;ts had become a separate caste.

 </p><p>Under this system the Bh&#225;ts acquired considerable wealth, as they usually demanded a percentage on the amount for which they became security. There are instances in which they presumed upon the strength of their engagements and sacred character to bully or dictate to their employer. Such was the case of the R&#225;val of Bh&#225;vnagar in 1808, which is also interesting in another way, as showing how the spirit of industry and commerce tends to sap the old observances which have their roots in superstition. This chief engaged in trade, fostered merchants, and increased his revenue. When his security, a Bh&#225;t, got troublesome and interfering, he applied to the power to whom he paid tribute to have the old security bond cancelled and a fresh one taken on his own personal responsibility. In doing this he seems to have been prompted by nothing but his appreciation of the modern code of commercial honour.

 </p><p>To return to the <hi>mulakgiri</hi>. The tribute for which preliminary security had been taken seems to have fluctuated from year to year, but always with reference to a fixed standard. It was one of the Mar&#225;tha rules never to recede from a former demand lest they should be thereby setting up a precedent for future years. They preferred to secure a year or two&#8217;s arrears at the full rate to the payment of all the arrears due at a reduced rate.

 </p><p>In spite of this fiction of a settled <hi>jama</hi> or tribute, the Mar&#225;th&#225;s, when they had a sufficient force at their back, invariably demanded a larger sum, the excess being called <hi>khar&#225;-j&#225;t</hi> or extra distinct from the actual tribute. This ingenious plan of increasing the collections originated, it is said, with Shivr&#225;m G&#225;rdi, and was carried out scrupulously by both B&#225;b&#225;ji and Vithalr&#225;v in their tours. In fact during the last few years of the old system Vithalr&#225;v had so good a force with him that the extra demand formed a large proportion of the whole tribute collected and had been paid only under strong protest. <note place="margin">British Intervention.</note>The British had not long been established in R&#225;npur, Gogha, and Dhandhuka before a few petty chiefs of Gohilv&#225;d and Sorath applied to the Resident at Baroda for protection against the mulakgiri of the Naw&#225;b of <corr sic="J&#250;n&#225;ga&#7693;h">Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h</corr> and the R&#225;val of Bh&#225;vnagar, offering to cede the sovereignty of their states to the British on condition that certain rights and privileges were preserved to the chiefs and their families. The conditions they named were not such as were likely to meet with the approval of the British Government, and do <pb id="pb422" n="422"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item><item>British Intervention.</item></list> </fw>not seem to have received much consideration. The proposals had, however, the effect of drawing the attention of the Bombay Government towards the state of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a, and permission to aid the mulakgiri of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r by detaching a few companies of British troops was accorded by the Supreme Government. The outbreak of hostilities with Sindia led to the whole question as to the best means of collecting the tribute being for a time deferred. The internal disputes of some of the more turbulent states, a few years afterwards, gave the Resident an opportunity of sending an envoy to one or two courts to see how matters stood, and to open a way for a settlement in conjunction with the G&#225;ikw&#225;r. Affairs at Baroda, as mentioned above (page 416), detained the Resident there till 1807, in which year he joined Vithalr&#225;v&#8217;s army with a British contingent, at a place in the Morvi state.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Settlement of 1807.</note>Before treating directly with the chiefs a circular was sent round to all of them both by the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s agent and by Colonel Walker the Resident, containing the basis of the proposals with regard to the tribute about to be submitted to them. The position of the British Government throughout this negotiation is not clearly defined. Vithalr&#225;v in his circular mentions indeed that a British force was with his own, but urges the chiefs to come to a settlement entirely with the government he represented. Colonel Walker&#8217;s note was longer, more explicit, and conciliatory, but at the same time assumes a tone of protection and superiority. The replies of the chiefs were various, and, as a rule, seem to show that they regarded the British Government as the chief mover in these negotiations. They were probably aware of the position in which the engagements of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r had placed him with reference to the British, and for some years had had the latter as their neighbours in the east of the peninsula. They were therefore not able at once to take in the whole scope of the action of the British Government in the tribute question.

 </p><p>Many seemed to take the note as a preliminary to a mulakgiri on the part of the East India Company. The R&#225;ja of M&#225;lia, who had just been causing disturbances in the dominions of all his neighbours, had repulsed B&#225;b&#225;ji and permitted the self-immolation of a Bh&#225;t rather than fulfil an engagement, openly proposed a joint expedition across the Ran to plunder Kachh and Sindh. From the inquiries made by the Resident and from information gathered from the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s accounts, it was anticipated that separate engagements need only be entered into with the twenty-nine chiefs to whom the circular invitation had been issued, provided that the rights and interests of subordinate members of the Bh&#225;y&#225;d were clearly defined in the agreement. When, however, these rights came to be investigated in the light of the peculiar rules of <corr sic="Rajput">R&#225;jput</corr> inheritance, it was found that no less than one hundred and fifty-three persons had a claim to settle independently of each other for their tribute. This greatly prolonged the settlement, but at last the agreements were all framed on one principle. The amount settled was determined by a close scrutiny of the collections of past years, and Colonel Walker found it advisable to make great <pb id="pb423" n="423"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item></list> </fw>reductions in the item of extras or <hi>khar&#225;j&#225;t</hi>, for which the later G&#225;ekw&#225;r collectors had such predilection. The engagements were of the following nature.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Settlement of 1807. <lb/><hi>Financial.</hi></note>First, the chief bound himself his heirs and successors to pay at Baroda each year the tribute fixed in perpetuity in 1807. He also procured a counter security for this payment who engaged himself in this capacity for ten years. The Honourable Company&#8217;s government had then to become security on the part of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r for the fixity of the tribute demanded. This participation of the British in the engagement was insisted upon by the chiefs, and in all probability Colonel Walker was not averse from admitting it. Having thus arranged for the payment of the tribute and guaranteed the amount to be demanded, it was proposed to take measures to prevent internal quarrels between the chiefs themselves. The object of a fixed settlement was simply to remove the necessity for overrunning the country from time to time with an irregular army and to protect the chiefs against extortion. It was found that if the army of the paramount power were removed, all means of keeping order in the province would be lost, and the internecine feuds of the chiefs would soon destroy the good effects of the permanent settlement by materially altering the then existing position of the weaker feudatories and rendering them unable to pay the tribute. It was also the wish of the British Government to bring about such a state of things in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a that the presence of an army to control the chiefs would be wholly uncalled-for and that the chiefs themselves would co-operate to keep order and maintain the permanent settlement.

 </p><p><note place="margin"><hi>Political.</hi></note>A second agreement therefore was called for from each signatory state of the nature of a security for good and peaceful conduct. The counter security to this was usually that of another chief. This bond was perpetual. On the execution of both these engagements the chief received a <hi>parv&#225;na</hi> or guarantee that the G&#225;ikw&#225;r government would not take from him more than the tribute agreed upon, and to this deed the countersignature of the Resident on behalf of the British Government was affixed. This guarantee, like the promise of the chief himself, was apparently given in perpetuity. It will be noted that the amount of tribute was fixed permanently, but that it was considered advisable to renew the security every ten years. It is also remarkable that, except in the <hi>failz&#225;min</hi> or bond for good behaviour, the name of the Peshwa&#8217;s government, the rights of which over the tribute had only been temporarily alienated, does not appear. The total amount of the tribute thus settled was <abbr>Rs.</abbr> 9,79,882.

 </p><p>By means of these engagements the relations of the tributaries to their paramount power were made a matter of contract, instead of as heretofore a series of uncertain and arbitrary exactions dependent upon the respective means of coercion and resistance.

It was not until 1815, when the Resident at Poona was trying to procure the renewal of the lease for the G&#225;ikw&#225;r, that an account of the settlement was drawn up in a draft agreement which the Resident submitted to B&#225;jir&#225;v. In this draft the curious mistake was made of mentioning the settlement instead of only the security bond as decennial. The Peshwa, whose policy was to protract negotiations, submitted in his turn a second draft which he said he was willing to sign. In this he seized at once on the supposition that the tribute was fixed only for ten years and stipulated for an increase at the expiration of that period. He also demanded that certain extra collections should be refunded by the G&#225;ikw&#225;r, and assumed the British Government to have become security for the tribute owed by the chiefs to his own government.

 </p><p>It was evident that no accord would be reached on the lines of either of these draft agreements as they stood. Before others were prepared, Gang&#225;dhar Sh&#225;stri had been murdered and the treaty of June 1817 was a completed act, leaving further negotiations unnecessary.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Later Arrangements.</note>Meanwhile the tribute since the expiry of the farm of 1804 had been collected by a joint British and G&#225;ikw&#225;r expedition, for it was found that partly from their own disputes and partly owing to the instigation of the agents of B&#225;jir&#225;v, the chiefs were little disposed to act up to the engagements of 1807, either with respect to tribute or good conduct. The Peshwa, whose interference in the affairs of the peninsula had been constantly discouraged, declined to trouble himself to collect the tribute, the responsibility of which he asserted rested entirely upon the British and G&#225;ikw&#225;r governments. He subsequently ceded the tribute to the British Government on account of military expenses. After his fall in 1819 his territories, including the rights in Gujar&#225;t, fell to the British Government, and in 1820 the G&#225;ikw&#225;r arranged that the whole of the K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a tribute, except that due from the districts directly subordinate to Baroda, should be collected by the agency of the British.

 </p><p><note place="margin">The Mahi K&#225;ntha.</note>Turning to the events on the mainland, we find that soon after Colonel Walker&#8217;s return from the K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a expedition, he introduced the K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a tribute system into the Mahi K&#225;ntha, in spite of the opposition of Sit&#225;r&#225;m R&#225;vji and the anti-English party in the Darb&#225;r.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Supplementary Treaty, 1808.</note>The territory ceded for the payment of the British contingent in 1805 was found to yield less revenue than had been anticipated, so in 1808 a treaty supplementary to the consolidating one of 1805 was drawn up, allotting additional assignments amounting to about 1,76,168 rupees to the British. This revenue was derived partly from alienated villages in Na&#7693;i&#225;d, Mahudha, Dholka, M&#225;tar, and near the Ranjar Gh&#225;t. The <hi>gh&#225;sd&#225;na</hi> or tribute of Bh&#225;vnagar was also made over by this agreement. With regard to this latter <pb id="pb425" n="425"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item></list> </fw>acquisition, it is to be noticed that the agreement is drawn up in the name of the Honourable Company alone, and not in that of the British Government on account of &#193;nandr&#225;v G&#225;ikw&#225;r. It also differs from other engagements of a similar nature in containing a provision against the contingency of future irregular demands being made by the Peshwa&#8217;s army. The reason for this distinction is evidently that the Bh&#225;vnagar contribution was not part of the K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a revenue farmed to the G&#225;ikw&#225;r by B&#225;jir&#225;v, and was thus not divisible on the expiration of the lease. The right to this tribute rested with the British by virtue of the previous cession of Gogha, of which sub-division the fifty nine villages of the Bh&#225;vnagar Bh&#225;y&#225;d formed part.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Okh&#225;mandal, 1809.</note>Next year the Okh&#225;mandal chiefs, who had not come under the settlement of 1807, were driven to engage not to continue their piratical depredations along the coast, and to admit one Sundarji Shivji as Resident on behalf of the British Government. The G&#225;ikw&#225;r government then, too, seems to have become their counter security, an arrangement which led to misunderstandings a short while afterwards.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Disturbances in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a, 1811.</note>In 1811, some disturbances in Nav&#225;nagar and Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h and symptoms of discontent in Okh&#225;mandal took the Resident from Baroda into the peninsula with part of the British contingent.

 </p><p>The J&#225;m of Nav&#225;nagar had got involved in pecuniary transactions with the R&#225;v of Kachh, and the British Government had mediated with a view of arranging for the repayment by gradual instalments. The J&#225;m, however, repudiated all the engagements of 1807 both as regards the debt and the tribute, ejected the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s agent from his dominions, and prepared for war. He also began to incite the neighbouring chiefs to join in sweeping out the paramount power from the whole of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a. It was not till after a considerable show of force that he laid down his arms and came to terms. Captain Carnac, the Resident, got him to submit the Kachh claims to the arbitration of the English Government, and after fixing them at <abbr>Rs.</abbr> 4,33,830, Captain Carnac made an arrangement similar to that originally intended.

 </p><p>There remained the question of a disputed succession in Jun&#225;ga&#7693;h. Bah&#225;dur Kh&#225;n, son of a slave girl, was put forward in opposition to a younger aspirant, Sal&#225;bat Kh&#225;n, reputed to be the son of a lady of the R&#225;dhanpur house. The Baroda government with the concurrence of the Resident had admitted the claims of the latter. On a report, however, by the Assistant Resident in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a<corr sic=".">,</corr> Captain Carnac was induced to alter his opinion and to support Bah&#225;dur Kh&#225;n, on the grounds that Sal&#225;bat Kh&#225;n was a spurious child, and that Bah&#225;dur was ready to make concessions of value to the G&#225;ikw&#225;r government. The Bombay Council, however, disavowed all countenance of the claims of Bah&#225;dur Kh&#225;n, and the matter was let drop.

 </p><p><note place="margin">1812.</note>In the year 1812 the G&#225;ikw&#225;r had paid off the pecuniary loan borrowed in 1803 from the British Government, but there still <pb id="pb426" n="426"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item></list> </fw>remained the debts for which that government had become <hi>bhand&#225;ri</hi> or security in place of the ejected <hi>jam&#225;d&#226;rs</hi> of the Arab force. These claims could not be paid off for at least two years longer, so that for that period the Resident was ordered to maintain the same close supervision of Baroda affairs as heretofore.

 </p><p><note place="margin">1813&#8211;14.</note>The next two years were spent chiefly in discussions with the Poona government about the old claims by the Peshwa on the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s estate. There is no doubt that at the time of his death, D&#225;m&#225;ji had not paid up nearly all that he had bound himself in 1753 to pay. On the other hand there had been at least six intermediate compacts between the Peshwa and various members of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r family. Amongst others was that of 1768 fixing the arrears of the previous three years, that of 1778 and of 1781, by the tenth clause of which Fatehsingh was excused payment of arrears for the time during which he was engaged in hostilities against R&#225;ghob&#225;. Then came the agreement with Govindr&#225;v in 1797, to which a sort of debit and credit account is appended.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Peshwa Intrigue in Baroda, 1814.</note>The Peshwa had been content, for reasons that have been shown above, to let these claims lie dormant during the currency of the ten years&#8217; farm. But, as the question of the renewal of this agreement became imminent, he gradually opened more frequent communications with the Baroda council, using these claims as a pretext for sounding the disposition of the chief officials and ascertaining their feelings especially towards the British Government. When the negotiations for the settlement of these claims were fairly set on foot, he used every possible means to protract them till he had finally decided what he should do in 1814, when the Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d farm expired.

 </p><p>It was easy for B&#225;jir&#225;v to discover who were the malcontents at the Baroda Court. Sit&#225;r&#225;m, the adopted son of R&#225;vji &#193;pp&#225;ji, having been found both incompetent and untrustworthy in the management of affairs, had been practically removed from any post of influence in the council, and was moreover chafing at the refusal of the British Government to recognize him in the same way as they had done his father. He had also been superseded as Suba of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a by Vithalr&#225;v Dev&#225;ji. Under these circumstances, and finding that he had the support of a large number of the older court party against the authority of the Resident and of his native agent, he either himself opened communications with B&#225;jir&#225;v or readily listened to the counsels sent to him direct from Poona. Before long, agents were sent to the Peshwa&#8217;s Court by Takhtb&#225;i, wife of &#193;nandr&#225;v, with instructions, it is supposed, to thwart all the proposals and designs of Gang&#225;dhar Sh&#225;stri, who had been recently sent as envoy by the G&#225;ikw&#225;r council of administration. The chief obstacle to the settlement of the Peshwa&#8217;s claims was the counter-demand made by the Baroda government on account of Broach, which had been disposed of without the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s consent, and also on account of the damage caused by the inroads of &#193;ba Shelukar, when accredited agent of B&#225;jir&#225;v in Gujar&#225;t.

 </p><p>There is no need to detail here the events that took place in Poona during these negotiations. On the expiration of the farm in 1814, <pb id="pb427" n="427"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item><item>Peshwa Intrigue in Baroda, 1814.</item></list> </fw>B&#225;jir&#225;v appointed Trimbakji Dengle Sarsuba of Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d. The latter, however, did not leave Poona, where his presence was indispensable to his master, but sent agents with instructions rather of a political than of a fiscal nature. He himself undertook the task of disposing of Gang&#225;dhar Sh&#225;stri, whom he caused to be assassinated at Pandharpur in July 1815.

 </p><p>Meanwhile the J&#225;m of Nav&#225;nagar had died leaving a disputed succession. The chief&#8217;s Khav&#225;s or family slaves, instigated probably by agents from Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d, began to usurp the government, and the whole question was submitted by the Darb&#225;r to the Peshwa as being lord paramount. The Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d commander sent a body of two hundred cavalry to Nav&#225;nagar, but before they could arrive, the Khav&#225;s&#8217; revolt had been quelled by a British force detached from the contingent. They therefore dispersed through the province inciting discontent and revolt amongst the J&#225;ts and K&#225;this. In Kaira they instigated a tribe of Kolis to attack the British lines by night. Sit&#225;r&#225;m R&#225;vji&#8217;s adherents also collected a force at Dh&#225;r, a state well-known for lending itself for such purposes, and kept the frontier in confusion. Severe measures at Poona and Baroda soon put an end to this state of things, and at last Trimbakji Dengle was surrendered to the British Government to answer for his share in the murder of Gang&#225;dhar Sh&#225;stri. The discussion of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s debts, however, was carried on all through the year at Poona, whilst B&#225;jir&#225;v was maturing his then vacillating plans for extirpating the British from the west of India.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Okh&#225;mandal ceded to the G&#225;ikw&#225;r.</note>In 1816 the chiefs of Okh&#225;mandal again betook themselves to piracy. Their territory was occupied by a British force. It will be remembered that in 1809 the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s government had become counter security for these chiefs, but owing to the distance of the district from a military post, the Baroda authorities found themselves unable to spare troops enough to put a check on the misconduct of their tributaries. In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1816, at the time of occupation, the Bombay Government informed the Baroda administration that they had no wish to permanently establish themselves at so distant a spot, which contained, moreover, a much frequented shrine of Hindu worship, and that they were willing to put the G&#225;ikw&#225;r in possession if he would engage to keep up a sufficient force in the district to protect the neighbouring ports and shores from the pirates and wreckers that infested the island of Dw&#225;rk&#225; and the adjoining mainland. The Bombay Government made a point of asserting on this occasion, in opposition apparently to some proposal by the Baroda Darb&#225;r, that they could not admit that the mere fact of having become security or counter-security gave any preferential right to the possession of the country. Finally, the G&#225;ikw&#225;r government agreed to the condition proposed, and the district was made over to them.

The escape of Trimbakji Dengle from Th&#225;na, and the subsequent attempts of the Peshwa to prevent the re-capture of his favourite and to re-unite the Mar&#225;tha confederacy, led to the execution of a fresh treaty on June 13th, 1817, in accordance with the orders of the Supreme Government.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Treaty of Poona, 1817.</note>It was intended to bind the Peshwa in such a way that he could never again enjoy the ascendancy amongst the Mar&#225;tha chiefs to which he aspired. The Resident at Poona took this opportunity of also putting an end to the discussions about the mutual claims on each other by the Poona and Baroda governments. The Peshwa agreed to abandon all claims on any territory in possession of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r and to accept an annual payment of four l&#225;khs of rupees in satisfaction of all previous debts. The farm of Gujar&#225;t was made perpetual to the G&#225;ikw&#225;r on the payment of four and a half l&#225;khs annually, but the K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a tribute was made over to the British Government in liquidation of military expenses. The latter Government, by this treaty, also entered into possession of the Peshwa&#8217;s revenue in Gujar&#225;t, except that of Ulp&#225;d, which had been assigned to a favourite officer. All the Peshwa&#8217;s rights north of the Narbada were also ceded.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Treaty with the G&#225;ikw&#225;r, 1817&#8211;18.</note>These conditions necessitated a readjustment of the agreements with the G&#225;ikw&#225;r. On November 1817, a definitive treaty, afterwards supplemented by one of November 1818, was executed between the Baroda and British Governments. The force furnished by the former state was found inefficient and the employment of a larger body of British troops was therefore necessary. To pay for these the G&#225;ikw&#225;r ceded his share in the fort of Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d and the districts immediately surrounding that city.<note id="n428.1" n="1">Known as Daskroi.</note> He also made over some districts near Surat, and the town of Umreth in Kaira with the whole of the rights acquired by the perpetual farm of Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d.

Okh&#225;mandal having now been pacified, was also given up to the G&#225;ikw&#225;r, but revolted four months afterwards and was not again subdued for a considerable time.

 </p><p><note place="margin">1819.</note>At the final settlement of the dominions of the late Peshwa in 1819, the whole of his rights in Gujar&#225;t passed in sovereignty to the British, who remitted the four l&#225;khs due from the G&#225;ikw&#225;r in composition of arrears claimed by B&#225;jir&#225;v. <note place="margin">1820.</note>The next year a special inquiry was made into the respective shares of the Peshwa and Baroda governments in the K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a tribute and in the extra allowance levied by the G&#225;ikw&#225;r called <hi>gh&#225;s-d&#225;na</hi> allowance. In the course of this inquiry so many abuses of power and instances of extortion on the part of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s officers were brought to light, that the Bombay Government on these grounds, and on account also of the general deterioration in the province since the <pb id="pb429" n="429"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item><item>Close of the Mar&#225;tha Supremacy, 1819.</item></list> </fw>G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s troops were stationed there, prevailed upon Say&#225;jir&#225;v, who had now succeeded to the throne, to let the duty of collection be undertaken and superintended by a British officer stationed in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a, who should, however, employ the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s troops on occasions of necessity. A similar arrangement was made with regard to the Mahi K&#225;ntha, where the effects of the settlement of 1811 had been much weakened by the disorderly conduct of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s troops stationed there. The administration of nearly the whole of the province passed into the hands of the British and the period of Mar&#225;tha ascendancy came to an end.

 </p><p><note place="margin">General Review.</note>It remains to review generally the nature and characteristics of the Mar&#225;tha connection with Gujar&#225;t, the chief events in which have been chronicled above. The most prominent feature has already been indicated at the beginning of this section and is apparent throughout the whole narrative. It is, in fact, the small space in history occupied during this period by the people, compared with the share appropriated to the actions of the government and its delegates. The reasons for this are as easily seen as the fact itself. From first to last the Mar&#225;tha interests in Gujar&#225;t were, except at one or two special junctures, simply pecuniary ones. In comparison with other countries within reach of Mar&#225;tha arms, Gujar&#225;t has always had a very large proportion of inhabitants engaged in commerce and manufacturing industries. It was the object of &#346;iv&#225;ji to get as much booty as he could and carry it away then and there; hence the commercial classes and manufacturers presented the most favourable opportunities for pillage, and the agriculturists were at first only mulcted in forage and provisions. Rapidity of action was another of &#346;iv&#225;ji&#8217;s aims, so not only were his visits short and their effects transitory, but all his booty consisted of property that could be carried away by his horsemen. No women or followers accompanied his expeditions, no prisoners were made excepting the few who could afford to pay a heavy ransom. Torture was resorted to only when the captive was suspected of having concealed his treasure. Cows women and cultivators were, according to &#346;iv&#225;ji&#8217;s system, exempted from capture. Assignments on revenue were seldom made by him for fear of weakening his own authority. Subsequently the Mar&#225;tha demands became more regular and assumed the form of a certain proportion of the revenue. The <hi>sar-deshmukhi</hi> and <hi>chauth</hi> were supposed to be calculated on the standard assessment so as to avoid subsequent claims as tribute or over-collection. In reality, however, they consisted of a fixed share in actual collections together with whatever extras the officer in charge could manage to extort, and which were, of course, kept undefined in any agreement. The expeditions, too, moved more leisurely and in greater force. The passes and roads in their rear were protected by their own comrades, so that the booty could be brought to the Dakhan in carts, and more bulky property therefore was removed than in former times. The times, too, when the demands were likely to be made were known to the headmen of the district and village, so that the cultivators could be pressed beforehand to furnish their share of the <pb id="pb430" n="430"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item><item>General Review.</item></list> </fw>contributions. The extortion by this means passed from the commercial classes down to the agriculturists, the latter having also the burden of supporting a larger and more cumbrous army for a longer period.

 </p><p>When the power of the D&#225;bh&#225;de and his deputy the G&#225;ikw&#225;r was fairly established, a regular system of administration was introduced. It will be remembered that by the treaty of 1729 as few Mar&#225;tha officers were to be employed as possible beyond those necessary to collect the D&#225;bh&#225;de&#8217;s share of the revenue. In consequence, however, of the internal struggles of the Muhammadan chiefs, this minimum quota grew to be a large establishment, with the usual accompaniment of alienations and assignments for the support of the officers and their religious institutions which the weakness of the central power had allowed to become customary. The D&#225;bh&#225;de himself was non-resident and his deputy usually being too valuable an assistant to be spared from the arena of Dakhan politics, the collection was left to sub-deputies and their subordinates, who in turn delegated a great part of their duties to village officers and even to strangers. The D&#225;bh&#225;des, who were throughout more interested in the Dakhan than in Gujar&#225;t, had, no doubt, an idea of raising up a power in the latter province in opposition to the administration of the Peshwa, which was conducted purely by Br&#225;hman agency. It was soon evident, however, that all that could be done politically with Gujar&#225;t was to make it a treasury for the support of schemes that had to be carried out in the Dakhan.

 </p><p>The fertility of the soil and the facilities the country afforded for commerce and manufactures both tended to make it unlikely to become a field for recruiting. The inhabitants of the towns had fixed and lucrative occupations; the cultivators were mostly of a class which on account of the fertility of their land neither Muhammadan nor Mar&#225;tha had been able to impoverish. The Mar&#225;th&#225;s had still to seek for soldiers in the rugged and barren country on the Gh&#225;ts and in the Konkan, where the people could only look for a hand-to-mouth existence if they remained at home. The warlike tribes of Gujar&#225;t were, as has been already seen, too proud by birth and position to engage themselves to fight for any but their own race and interest. The aboriginal races were not likely to prove effective allies even if they had been willing to move from their own woods and fortresses. None of the Mar&#225;tha governors of <corr sic="Guj&#225;rat">Gujar&#225;t</corr> seem to have consistently attempted to weld the various interests subordinate to them into a cohesion and unity that they might have made politically useful against the Poona influence. All that they endeavoured to do was to draw from their charge as much revenue as possible and to keep out interlopers. To the taxpayer the result was the same, whether his district was invaded by Kant&#225;ji or Pil&#225;ji. If one anticipated the other in carrying off the harvest, the ryot still had to pay the latter for ejecting the intruder. The only resistance to be feared by the Mar&#225;th&#225;s was that, not of the cultivators, but of their own race or of the <corr sic="Rajput">R&#225;jput</corr> Gir&#225;si&#225;s. These latter were treated in all districts as mere robbers, probably because the class which bears that name near R&#225;jpipla<corr>,</corr> <pb id="pb431" n="431"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item><item>General Review.</item></list> </fw>where the Mar&#225;th&#225;s first came in contact with it subsists usually on blackmail. In the north, however, the Gir&#225;si&#225;s were landowners of great influence and fixed residence, not likely to be conciliated by the knowledge that the invaders of their country classed them along with Bhils and Kolis as <hi>mehv&#225;sis</hi> or outlaws.

 </p><p>In order to relieve the chief officials of direct responsibility for the revenue, the G&#225;ikw&#225;r towards the last quarter of the eighteenth century if not before, introduced the system of letting out each revenue sub-division in farm for from one to five years at a fixed annual rate. The farmer was as often as not an absentee, but the supervision and administration were never entrusted to any one but a Mar&#225;tha Br&#225;hman. The revenue for the year was settled by an inspection of the accounts of previous years and the crops of each village. The amount was taken in kind, but the actual distribution of the whole on individual cultivators was left to the headman, who was in most cases made responsible for the assessment imposed on his village.

 </p><p>The frequent passages of hostile armies and other causes had left much culturable land a desert. In order to restore the population and induce colonists to settle and cultivate in such spots, leases on favourable terms were granted to des&#225;is, who administered the land as they pleased, and were directly responsible to the head revenue authority of the sub-division for the annual rent. The patels and other village officials also made use of their position with reference to the foreign supervisors in appropriating large tracts of waste land to their own uses. The <hi>kam&#225;v&#237;sd&#225;r</hi> or farmer for the time being was interested only in recouping himself for the <corr sic="amout">amount</corr> he had agreed to pay the Mar&#225;tha government, together with a margin for bribes paid to underlings at head-quarters for good offices with regard to the farm. He was ready, therefore, to make use of any agency in collecting his revenue that he found effective, and which saved the cost of a personal establishment. In many parts of the country there were hereditary village headmen accustomed to the duty of extorting money from unwilling ryots. In other places, such for instance as Dholka, it had been customary for certain Muhammadans called Kasb&#225;tis, to become responsible for the revenue of certain villages in return for a discount on the <hi>jama</hi> or amount collected (<hi>manoti</hi>). These <hi>manotid&#225;rs</hi> were found so useful by the Mar&#225;tha officials that they gradually acquired an hereditary position and claimed proprietary rights in the villages for which they had been formerly mere agents for collection. They also acted as <hi>des&#225;is</hi> or colonists, and succeeded in getting their leases of certain tracts renewed long after they had ceased to actively improve the land, which had in fact been all brought under regular cultivation.

 </p><p>Such was the agency employed in administering the revenue. The <hi>kam&#225;v&#237;sd&#225;r</hi> was also the dispenser of justice both civil and criminal. As his object was to make money and not to improve the condition of his charge, his punishments consisted chiefly in fines, and most offences could be paid for. No record of trials was <pb id="pb432" n="432"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">The Mar&#225;th&#225;s</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1760&#8211;1819.</item><item>General Review.</item></list> </fw>kept except a memorandum of the amount passed at each decision to the credit of the farmer. In civil suits sometimes one-fourth of the amount in dispute was assigned as costs and appropriated by the court. The Gir&#225;si&#225;s in their own territory exercised somewhat similar jurisdiction, but grave crimes with violence were apparently left to the party injured or his relations to decide after the manner of the offence. Arbitration, too, was a frequent mode of deciding differences of both civil and criminal nature, but the <hi>kam&#225;v&#237;sd&#225;r</hi> or <hi>gir&#225;si&#225;</hi> usually managed that the State should not be a loser by such a method of settlement.

 </p><p>The whole system indicates clearly enough the slight hold the Mar&#225;th&#225;s had on the province and their desire to make the most out of it for the furtherance of court intrigues or political ends above the Gh&#225;ts. There is nothing to show that they contemplated a permanent colonization of the country until the British Government undertook the task of dividing the Mar&#225;tha nation by the establishment of a powerful and independent court at Baroda.

 </p><p>The home of the Mar&#225;th&#225;s was always the Dakhan, and for many years after they had effected a lodgment in Gujar&#225;t, their army regularly returned for the rainy season to the country from whence they originally came. Their leaders were encouraged to be as much as possible near the court by the D&#225;bh&#225;de, or the regent on the one side and by the Peshwa on the other: the former on account of their weight with the army and the Mar&#225;tha chiefs, the latter in order that their influence in a distant dependency might not grow beyond what prudence recommended or might be counteracted if its tendency to increase became manifest. For similar reasons no force was allowed to be maintained in Gujar&#225;t sufficient to consolidate the Mar&#225;tha acquisitions there into a manageable whole. D&#225;m&#225;ji G&#225;ikw&#225;r, had he lived, would undoubtedly have done much towards this end by means of his personal influence; but, as it happened, the thin crust of Mar&#225;tha domination rapidly disappeared before it either was assimilated into the system of the province or hardened over it. A military occupation of a large and civilised district at a distance from the mother-country, and prevented by the jealousy of the central authority and the short-sightedness of those in charge of its exploitation, from either conforming itself to the elements it found already established, or absorbing the vital forces of the government it dispossessed, a system without the breath of life, without elasticity, without the capacity of self-direction, imposed bodily upon a foreign people, without even the care of preparing a foundation, such seems to have been the Mar&#225;tha government, containing within itself all that was necessary to ensure a precarious, but while it lasted, an oppressive existence.

The story of the greased cartridges had been industriously repeated and found credulous listeners in every village. A similar incident occurred in Gujar&#225;t. A consignment of salt from the Ran of Kachh having been carried in bags which had previously held red ochre (<hi>sindur</hi>) had become discoloured. This was observed at S&#225;dra in the Mahi K&#225;ntha as the salt was in transit to <corr sic="Rajput&#225;na">R&#225;jput&#225;na</corr>, and a report was at once spread that the salt had been defiled with cow&#8217;s blood. It was believed in Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d and throughout Gujar&#225;t that this was a device of the British Government to destroy the caste of the people as a preliminary to their forcible conversion to Christianity.

 </p><p><note place="margin">The Passing of the Pariah Dog.</note>About the time that the cakes or <hi>chap&#225;tis</hi> were being circulated throughout the North-West of India, a common pariah dog was passed from village to village in the Panch Mah&#225;ls and eastern Gujar&#225;t. It was never ascertained who first set the dog in motion, but it came from the Central India frontier with a basket of food which was given to the village dogs, and a similar supply with the dog was forwarded to the next village. When pestilence or other calamity threatens an Indian village, it is the custom to take a goat or a buffalo to the boundary and drive it into the lands of the adjoining village, in the hope that it will avert evil from the community. A similar belief prevailed among the Jews. There is no reason to suppose that this movement of the dog in Gujar&#225;t was a signal of revolt or had any deeper political significance than a vague feeling that troublous times were approaching. Still it was by many regarded as an evil omen and created considerable alarm.<note id="n433.1" n="1"><p>The rite of passing cakes from village to village or of passing a dog from village to village is in such complete accord with magical and religious rites practised all over India that it seems hardly possible to accept either as meaningless or as accidental the passing of cakes and of a dog from one part of the country to another on the brink of the Mutinies. Knowing how suitable such a rite is to the state of feeling as well as to the phase of belief prevalent among the plotters of rebellion in Northern India it seems difficult to suppose that the passing of the cakes and the passing of the dog were not both sacramental; that is designed to spread over the country a spirit which had by religious or magical rites been housed in the dog and in the cakes. The cake-spirit, like the sugar-spirit of the Thags, was doubtless K&#225;li, the fierce longing for unbridled cruelty, which worked on the partaker of the Thag sugar with such power that he entered with zest and without remorse on any scheme however cowardly and cruel. Like the Thags those who ate the Mutiny cakes would by partaking become of one spirit, the spirit of the indwelling K&#225;li, and, in that spirit would be ready to support and to take part in any scheme of blood which the leaders of Mutiny might devise and start. Similarly by religious rites the Central India dog, possibly the dog of B&#225;iza B&#225;i of <corr sic="Gwalior">Gw&#225;lior</corr> (See Text page <ref type="pageref" target="pb437">437</ref>), had been made the home of some fierce war-spirit, apparently of the dog-formed Khandoba the Mar&#225;tha Sword God and Dog of War. The inspired dog and the inspired dogs-meat were passed through the land in the confidence that through them the spirit of unrest would pervade every village of Gujar&#225;t. Since the Mutinies, by the <pb/>magic of letters, K&#225;li has passed from the wafer into the leaflet, and the paid political propagandist has taken the place of Khandoba&#8217;s pariah dog.

 </p><p>The correctness of the view suggested above is supported if not established by certain passages in Kaye&#8217;s Sepoy War, I. 632&#8211;642. Chuni says; &#8216;The circulating of cakes was supposed to foretell disturbance and to imply an invitation to the people to unite for some secret purpose.&#8217; According to the king of Delhi&#8217;s physician (page 636) some charm attached to the cakes. The people thought they were made by some adept in the secret arts to keep unpolluted the religion of the country. Another authority (page 637) says; &#8216;The first circulation of the cakes was on the authority of a pandit who said the people would rise in rebellion if cakes were sent round and that the person in whose name the cakes were sent would rule India.&#8217; The secret comes out in <corr sic="Sitar&#225;m">Sit&#225;r&#225;m</corr> B&#225;w&#225;&#8217;s evidence (pages 646&#8211;648); &#8216;The cakes in question were a charm or <hi>j&#225;du</hi> which originated with D&#225;sa B&#225;wa the <hi>guru</hi> or teacher of N&#225;na S&#225;heb. D&#225;sa told N&#225;na S&#225;heb he would make a charm and as far as the magic cakes should be carried so far should the people be on his side. He then took lotusseed-dough called <hi>mak&#225;na</hi> and made an idol of it. He reduced the idol to very small pills and having made an immense number of cakes he put a pillet in each and said that as far as the cakes were carried so far would the people determine to throw off the Company&#8217;s yoke.&#8217; With this making of a cake as a sacramental home of Durga or K&#225;li compare the Buddhist of Tibet offering in a human skull to the M&#225;h&#225;r&#225;ni or Queen, that is to Durga or K&#225;li, a sacramental cake made of black-goat&#8217;s fat, wine, dough, and butter. (Waddell&#8217;s Buddhism in Tibet, 365.). As to the effect of sharing in Durga&#8217;s mutiny cakes compare the statement of the Thag Faringia (Sleeman&#8217;s Ramaseeana, page 216); The sugar sacrament, <hi>gur-tap&#225;vani</hi>, changes our nature. Let a man once taste the sacramental sugar and he will remain a Thag however skilful a craftsman, however well-to-do. The Urdu proverb says <hi>Tapauni-ki-dhaunika gur jisne kh&#225;y&#225; wuh wais&#225; hu&#225;</hi> Who eats the sugar of the sacramental Vase as he is so he remains. The Thags are tools in the hand of the god they have eaten. (Compare Ramaseeana, 76.)&#8212;J. M. C.</p></note>

When disturbances are impending natives invariably convert their savings into gold, because gold is more portable and more easily concealed than silver. A sudden and unusual demand for gold in the markets, especially by the native troops, had been observed. This fall of the political barometer should never be disregarded. It indicates the approach of a storm with great certainty.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Seditious Native Press.</note>The native press, which had been merely disloyal, now assumed an attitude of decided hostility. Every paper contained the most exaggerated accounts of the massacre of Europeans in the North-West Provinces, and absurd rumours were circulated of the approach of a combined Russian and Persian army, which, it was said, had reached Attok and would shortly invade Hindust&#225;n. It is much to be regretted that the measures which were found necessary in 1880 for the suppression of seditious publications were not enforced in 1857. Had this been done much evil would have been averted. The native mind would not have become familiar with the spectacle of the British Government held up to the execration and contempt of its subjects and the vilest motives attributed to every public measure.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Maulvi Sar&#225;j-ud-din.</note>The native press was not the only source of sedition. The fall of the British Government was openly predicted in every masjid, and in Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d a Maulvi named Sar&#225;j-ud-din became especially prominent by preaching a <hi>jeh&#225;d</hi> in the J&#225;ma Masjid to audiences of native officers and <hi>sav&#225;rs</hi> of the Gujar&#225;t Horse and troops from the <pb id="pb435" n="435"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">Gujar&#225;t Disturbances</hi>, 1857&#8211;1859.</item></list> </fw>Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d cantonment. The Maulvi was expelled from Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d and found his way to Baroda, where he was afterwards arrested; but the impunity he so long enjoyed brought great discredit upon Government, for it was very naturally supposed that a government which tamely submitted to be publicly reviled was too weak to resent the indignity. Oriental races are so accustomed to violent measures that they seldom appreciate moderation or forbearance. The generation that had known and suffered from the anarchy of the Peshwa had passed away. The seditious language of the native press and the masjid was addressed to a population too ignorant to understand the latent power of the British Government.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Apparent Weakness of British Rule.</note>In 1857 the immense continent of Hindust&#225;n was governed by what appeared to the people to be a few Englishmen unsupported by troops, for they knew that the native army was not to be depended on, and the European troops were so few that they were only seen in the larger military cantonments. It must have seemed an easy task to dispose of such a handful of men, and it probably never occurred to those who took part in the insurrection that the overthrow of the British Government would involve more serious operations than the capture or murder of the Europeans who governed the country so easily. They could not perceive that England would never submit to a defeat, and that the handful of men who ruled India were supported by the whole power of the nation. The plotters had no very definite ideas for the future. The Musalm&#225;ns regarded the subversion of a government of K&#225;firs as a triumph of Isl&#225;m, and both Muslims and Hindus looked forward to a period of anarchy during which they might indulge that appetite for plunder which had been restrained for so many years. The descendants of the feudal aristocracy of the Peshwa are an ignorant and improvident race deeply involved in debt. They could not fail to see that under the operation of our laws their estates were rapidly passing into the possession of the more intelligent mercantile classes, and they hoped to recover their position in the revolution that was about to ensue.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Administrative Defects.</note>A great change had taken place in the character of the administration. The civilians of the school of Duncan, Malcolm, and Mountstuart Elphinstone, though not deeply learned in the law, were accomplished earnest men, sufficiently acquainted with the unalterable principles of right and wrong to administer substantial justice to a simple people who had not yet learnt the art of lying. The people asked for justice rather than law. They were satisfied with the justice they obtained from the able and upright men who ruled this country during the first half of this century. The writings and official reports of the officers of that period indicate a knowledge of native customs and feelings and a sympathy with the people that is unknown in the present day, for knowledge and sympathy cannot be acquired except by a long and familiar residence amongst the people which is now becoming every year more impossible. When the overland route rendered communication with England more easy and frequent, a reaction set in against patriarchal administration. Concubinage with native women, which had been common, was now declared vulgar, if not immoral; and the <pb id="pb436" n="436"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">Gujar&#225;t Disturbances</hi>, 1857&#8211;1859.</item></list> </fw>relations between Europeans and Natives soon became less cordial than they had been during the early period of British rule. About this time a considerable immigration of lawyers appeared in India. <note place="margin">The Courts Disliked.</note>These briefless gentlemen, envious of the official monopoly of the Civil Service, raised an outcry that justice was being administered by men who had not acquired that knowledge of law which the formality of eating a certain number of dinners at the Temple was supposed to guarantee. They worked the press so industriously to this cry, that in the course of a few years they had succeeded in impressing their views on the Court of Directors in London and on the less intelligent members of the Civil Service in India.

 </p><p>Unfortunately the Sadar Court was then presided over by a succession of feeble old gentlemen who had not sufficient force of character to resist this selfish agitation, and by way of refuting the charge of ignorance of law devoted themselves to the study of those petty technicalities which have so often brought the administration of justice into contempt, and which the progress of law reform has not even now removed from the law of England. In 1827, Mountstuart Elphinstone had enacted a Civil and Criminal Code which was still the substantive law of the land. It was simple and admirably suited to the people, but justice was administered according to the spirit rather than the letter of the law. A district officer would have incurred severe censure if his decisions were found to be inequitable, however they might have been supported by the letter of the law. The national character for even-handed justice had made the English name respected throughout India and far across the steppes of Central Asia. But the demoralizing example of the Sadar Ad&#225;lat soon extended to the lower grades of the service. The Civil Service was afflicted with the foolishness which, we are told, precedes ruin. Its members diligently searched their law-books for precedents and cases, and rejoiced exceedingly if they could show their knowledge of law by reversing the decision of a lower Court on some long-forgotten ruling of the Courts of Westminster. The first effect of this evil was to fill the courts with corrupt and unprincipled <hi>vakils</hi> who perverted the course of justice by perjury, forgery, and fraud of every description. Litigation increased enormously, no cause was too rotten, no claim too fraudulent to deprive it of the chance of success. The grossest injustice was committed in the name of the law, and though the Civil Service was above all suspicion of corruption, the evil could hardly have been greater if the Judges had been corrupt. This state of affairs gave rise to great discontent, for the administration of justice fell almost entirely into the hands of the <hi>vakils</hi>. When men quarrelled they no longer said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll beat or I&#8217;ll kill you,&#8221; but &#8220;I&#8217;ll pay a <hi>vakil</hi> <abbr>Rs.</abbr> 50 to ruin you,&#8221; and too often this was no mere idle threat.

 </p><p><note place="margin">The In&#225;m Commission.</note>The operations of the In&#225;m Commission and of the Survey Department were also a fruitful cause of alarm and discontent. Many of the estates of the more influential J&#225;gh&#237;rd&#225;rs had been acquired by fraud or violence during the period of anarchy which preceded the fall of the Peshwa. The Patels and Deshmukhs had also appropriated large areas of lands and had made grants of villages to temples and assignments of revenue to Br&#225;hmans, religious mendicants, and dancing <pb id="pb437" n="437"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">Gujar&#225;t Disturbances</hi>, 1857&#8211;1859.</item><item>The In&#225;m Commission.</item></list> </fw>girls. The Peshwa had never recognized these alienations as any limitation of his rights, for he farmed his revenues, and so long as a large sum was paid into his treasury by the farmers it was immaterial to him how much land was alienated. But when the Survey Department revealed the fact that nearly a fourth part of the fertile province of Gujar&#225;t was unauthorizedly enjoyed by these parasites; and that in other districts the proportion of alienations was nearly equally large, a due regard for the public interests demanded that there should be an investigation into the title on which the lands were held rent-free. It became the duty of the In&#225;m Commission to make this inquiry, and though a very small portion of land was resumed or rather assessed to the land revenue and the rules for the continuation of cash allowances were extremely liberal, they could hardly be expected to give satisfaction to those who had so long enjoyed immunity from any share of the public burdens. The Br&#225;hmans and the priesthood of every sect deeply resented the scrutiny of the In&#225;m Commission and excited an intensely fanatical spirit by representing the inquiry as a sacrilegious attack on their religious endowments and a departure from the principle of neutrality and toleration which had been the policy of Government from a very early period.

 </p><p><note place="margin">The Army Disloyal.</note>Notwithstanding all these elements of danger there would probably have been no revolt if the army had remained loyal. Fortunately the Bombay army was composed of a great variety of races, Musalm&#225;ns of the Shia and Sunni sects, Mar&#225;th&#225;s of the Dakhan and Konkan, Parv&#225;ris, Pardeshis, and a few Jews and Christians. Little community of sentiment could exist, in so heterogeneous a force, and to this circumstance we may trace the failure of each mutinous outbreak in the regiments of the Bombay army. Many of its regiments had, however, recruited extensively in the North-West Provinces which were then the centre of the political cyclone, and it was soon discovered that seditious overtures were being made to them not only by their brethren in the regiments which had already mutinied, but by discontented persons of higher rank. <note place="margin">B&#225;iza B&#225;i of Gw&#225;lior.</note>The most important of these was a clever woman known as the B&#225;iza B&#225;i. She was the daughter of a Dakhan Sard&#225;r named Sirji R&#225;o Gh&#225;tke, and had been married in early life to His Highness Dowlat R&#225;o Sindia the Mah&#225;r&#225;ja of Gw&#225;lior. On his death she had been allowed to adopt Jankoji R&#225;o as heir to the <hi>g&#225;di</hi>, and during his minority she had been appointed by the British Government Regent of the <corr sic="Gwalior">Gw&#225;lior</corr> state. In this position the B&#225;i had accumulated great wealth. She had deposited &#163;370,000 (37 l&#225;khs of rupees) for safe custody in the treasury at Benares, and it was known that she had other resources at <corr sic="Gwalior">Gw&#225;lior</corr>. Her avarice and ambition were insatiable. She sent emissaries to all the Mar&#225;tha chiefs and Th&#225;kors in Western India calling on them to take up arms and restore the empire of Shiv&#225;ji. She appealed to the troops, urging them to emulate the deeds of their comrades in the Bengal army who had already nearly exterminated the Europeans in the North-West, and warned them that if they did not now strike in defence of their religion they would shortly be converted to Christianity and made to drink the blood of the sacred cow.

Gujar&#225;t was still tranquil. It is true there had been a riot in Broach originating in a long-standing feud between the P&#225;rsis and Musalm&#225;ns of that town, but it had no political significance and had been promptly suppressed. The ringleaders were arrested, tried, and sentenced to be hanged for the murder of a P&#225;rsi, but there is no reason to suppose that this disturbance had any immediate connection with the outbreak in the North-West. It was probably only a coincidence, but the violence of the rioters was no doubt encouraged by the weakness of our position in Gujar&#225;t, and the exaggerated rumours which reached them of the massacre of our countrymen.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Mutiny at Mhow, July 1857.</note>On July 1st, 1857, the 23rd Bengal Native Infantry and the 1st Bengal Cavalry stationed at Mhow mutinied and murdered Colonel Platt, Captain Fagan, Captain Harris, and a number of European subordinates of the Telegraph Department. The troops of His Highness Holkar fraternized with the mutineers, attacked the Residency, and after a desultory fight drove out Colonel Durand the Resident, who took refuge in Bhop&#225;l with the surviving Europeans of Indor. Information of the mutiny at Mhow soon reached Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d, and treasonable negotiations were at once opened for a simultaneous rising of the Gujar&#225;t Horse and of the troops in the cantonment; but they could not agree to combined operations. The Mar&#225;th&#225;s hoped for the restoration of the dynasty of the Peshwa, while the Pardeshis looked towards Dehli where their brethren were already in arms, without any very definite comprehension of what they were fighting for, but with some vague idea that they would establish a Musalm&#225;n <hi>R&#225;j</hi> on the throne of the Great Mughal.

They were followed by the Adjutant, Lieutenant Pym, with twelve <hi>sav&#225;rs</hi>, and Captain Taylor, the commandant, joined them soon after with three men of the Koli Corps, whom he had met on the Dholka road. The <hi>sav&#225;rs</hi> were overtaken near the village of T&#225;jpor, and having taken up a strong position between three survey boundary-marks opened fire on their officers and the Kolis, the <hi>sav&#225;rs</hi> standing aloof. After many shots had been exchanged without result, Captain Taylor advanced to parley, and while endeavouring to reason with his men was shot through the body. The Kolis now re-opened fire and having shot two of the <hi>sav&#225;rs</hi> the rest laid down their arms. They were tried under Act XIV. of 1857 and hanged. The <hi>sav&#225;rs</hi> who followed Lieutenant Pym passively declined to act against their comrades, and if the Kolis had not been present the mutineers would have escaped. Captain Taylor&#8217;s wound was severe; the bullet passed through his body, but he eventually recovered. The execution of the <hi>sav&#225;rs</hi> had a good effect on the troops, but it became evident that a serious struggle was impending, and Lord Elphinstone, who was then at the head of the Bombay Government, took all the precautions that were possible under the circumstances.

The fog was so dense that it was impossible to use firearms effectively. Mr. Lawrence of the Civil Service was the only person wounded. A party of the 17th Bombay Native Infantry who were on duty at &#193;bu, were suspected of complicity with the Jodhpur Legion and were disarmed. The head-quarters of the Legion mutinied at Erinpur on the same day as the attack at &#193;bu; they made the Adjutant, Lieutenant Conolly, prisoner and plundered the treasury.

The two Native regiments quartered at Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d were the 2nd Regiment of Grenadiers and the 7th Native Infantry. The Grenadiers were chiefly Pardeshis from Oudh, while the majority of the 7th Regiment were Mar&#225;th&#225;s. As is often the case, an enmity sprang up between the two regiments. One night Captain Muter of the 2nd Grenadiers was visiting the guards as officer of the day. On approaching the quarter guard of the 7th Regiment, the sentry demanded the password which Captain Muter could not give. The sentry very properly refused to let him pass. Captain Muter returned to his lines, called out a party of Grenadiers, and made the sentry a prisoner. Next morning General Roberts put Captain Muter under arrest and released the sentry. This incident intensified the ill-feeling between the two regiments, and prevented their combination when the Grenadiers mutinied a few days later. It had been arranged that the two Native Regiments and the Golandauz artillery should mutiny at the same time, but there was mutual distrust between them, and the Native officers of the artillery had stipulated that they should make a show of resistance in order to let it appear that they had been overpowered by a superior force. About midnight on the 14th September 1857 the Grenadiers turned out and fell in on their parade ground armed and loaded. The guns were also brought out and loaded on their own parade ground. A Native officer of the Grenadiers was sent with a party to take possession of the guns in accordance with the preconcerted agreement, but the Subhed&#225;r of the Artillery threatened to fire on them, and the Native officer expecting that the guns would be given up without resistance, <corr sic="tho ught">thought</corr> he had been betrayed, and retreated with his party, who threw away their arms as they ran across the parade ground. The Grenadiers were under arms on the parade waiting for the guns, when seeing the disorder in which the party was retreating from the Artillery lines, they also were seized with a panic and broke up in confusion. Then for the first time the Native officers reported to Colonel Grimes that there had been a slight disturbance in the lines. The mere accident that the Native officer detached to take the guns had not been informed of the show of resistance he was to expect from the Artillery, probably averted the massacre of every European in Gujar&#225;t. Twenty-one loaded muskets were found on the parade ground, and though the whole regiment was guilty it was decided to try the owners of those muskets by court martial. They were sentenced to death. As it was doubtful if the Native troops would permit the execution it was considered prudent to await the arrival of the 89th Regiment under Colonel Ferryman and Captain Hatch&#8217;s battery of Artillery. They had been landed at Gogha during the monsoon with great difficulty, and were compelled to make a wide detour to the north owing to the flooded state of the country. On their arrival the executions were carried out; five of the mutineers were blown from guns, three were shot with musketry, and the rest were hanged in the presence of the whole of the troops. They <pb id="pb441" n="441"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">Gujar&#225;t Disturbances</hi>, 1857&#8211;1859.</item></list> </fw>met their death with a gentlemanly calmness which won the respect of all who were present.

 </p><p><note place="margin">R&#225;dhanpur Disloyal.</note>The example thus made, together with the presence of the European troops in Gujar&#225;t, restored our prestige and gave us time to attend to affairs on our frontier. The whole country was in a very disturbed state. On the fall of Delhi on September 28th, 1857, a treasonable correspondence was found between the Naw&#225;b of R&#225;dhanpur in Gujar&#225;t and the Emperor of Delhi, which deeply implicated the Naw&#225;b. He and his ministers had forwarded <hi>nazr&#225;n&#225;s</hi> of gold <hi>mohars</hi> to Delhi and asked for orders from the Emperor, offering to attack the British cantonments at Disa and Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d. The Naw&#225;b had been on the most friendly terms with Captain Black the Political Agent, and had been considered perfectly loyal. Preparations were made to depose him for this treacherous conduct. We were then so strong in Gujar&#225;t that his estate could have been seized without the least difficulty, but he was considered too contemptible an enemy and his treason was pardoned.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Arab Outbreak at Sunth.</note>Lieutenant Alban, with a party of Gujar&#225;t Horse, was now sent to settle affairs in Sunth, a petty state in the Rewa K&#225;ntha. Mustapha Kh&#225;n, at the head of a turbulent body of Arabs, had made the R&#225;ja a prisoner in his own palace with a view to extort arrears of pay and other claims. Lieutenant Alban&#8217;s orders were to disarm the Arabs. After some negotiations Mustapha Kh&#225;n waited on Lieutenant Alban. He was attended by the whole of his armed followers with the matches of their matchlocks alight, thinking no doubt to intimidate Lieutenant Alban. On entering the tent Lieutenant Alban disarmed him, but imprudently placed his sword on the table. While they were conversing Mustapha Kh&#225;n seized his sword and Lieutenant Alban immediately shot him with a revolver. The Arabs who crowded round the tent now opened fire on Alban and his men, but they were soon overpowered. Mustapha Kh&#225;n, four Arabs, and one <hi>sav&#225;r</hi> of the Gujar&#225;t Horse were killed.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Want of Combination.</note>It is very remarkable that the sepoy war did not produce one man who showed any capacity for command. Every native regiment was in a state of mutiny and a large proportion of the civil population was ripe for revolt. If only one honest man had been found who could have secured the confidence and support of his fellow-countrymen, the fertile province of Gujar&#225;t would have been at his mercy; but amongst natives conflicting interests and mutual distrust make combination most difficult. In India a conspirator&#8217;s first impulse is to betray his associates lest they should anticipate him. The failure of every mutinous outbreak in Gujar&#225;t was due to this moral defect. This trait may be traced throughout the history of the war and should be studied by those who advocate the independence of India, and the capacity of the native for self-government. It is an apt illustration of native inability to organize combined operations that the most formidable conspiracy for the subversion of our power should have been delayed till October 1857. By this time the arrival of Her Majesty&#8217;s 89th Regiment and a battery of European artillery at Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d had rendered a successful revolt impossible. The mutinies of the Gujar&#225;t Horse and Grenadiers had been promptly suppressed and severely punished. The termination of the monsoon had opened the ports and reinforcements were daily expected. Had the outbreak occurred simultaneously with the mutiny of the Gujar&#225;t Horse, the Artillery, and the Second Grenadiers, Gujar&#225;t must have been lost for a time and every European would have been murdered.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Mar&#225;tha Conspiracy.</note>For many years Govindr&#225;o <hi>alias</hi> B&#225;pu G&#225;ikw&#225;r, a half brother of His Highness the G&#225;ikw&#225;r, had resided near the Sh&#225;hib&#225;g at Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d. He had been deported from Baroda for intriguing against his brother and had been treated as a political refugee. This man with Malh&#225;rr&#225;o, another brother of His Highness the G&#225;ikw&#225;r, Bh&#225;u S&#225;heb Paw&#225;r, and a Sard&#225;r who called himself the Bhonsla R&#225;ja, also related to His Highness by marriage, conceived the design to murder the Europeans in Baroda Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d and Kaira and establish a government in the name of the R&#225;ja of S&#225;t&#225;ra. To B&#225;pu G&#225;ikw&#225;r was entrusted the task of tampering with the troops in Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d, and frequent meetings of the Native officers were held at his house every night. The Bhonsla R&#225;ja, with a man named Jhaveri N&#225;lchand, was deputed to the Kaira district to secure the aid of the Th&#225;kors of Umeta, Bh&#225;darva, Kera, and D&#225;ima, and of the Patels of &#193;nand and Part&#225;bpur.

An agent named Maganl&#225;l was sent into the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s Kadi Pargana, where he enlisted a body of 2000 foot and 150 horse, which he encamped near the village of Lodra. The followers of the Kaira Th&#225;kors assembled in the strong country on the banks of the Mahi near the village of Part&#225;bpur with a detachment and advanced to the Chauk Tal&#225;v within five miles of Baroda. The massacre at Baroda was fixed for the night of October 16th. The native troops in Baroda had been tampered with and had promised in the event of their being called out that they would fire blank ammunition only.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Gathering at Part&#225;bpur,</note>The Th&#225;kors had been encamped at Part&#225;bpur for several days, but owing partly to the sympathy of the people and partly to the terror which they inspired, no report was made to any British officers till the 15th October, when Mr. Ashburner, who was encamped at Th&#225;sra, marched to attack them with his new levies and a party of the Kaira police. There was, as usual, disunion in the ranks of the insurgents; they had no leaders they could depend upon, and they dispersed on hearing of the approach of Ashburner&#8217;s force without firing a shot. Ninety-nine men who had taken refuge in the ravines of the Mahi were captured and a commission under Act XIV. of 1857 was issued to Mr. Ashburner and Captain Buckle, the Political Agent in the Rewa K&#225;ntha, to try them. Ten of the ringleaders were found guilty of treason and blown from guns at Kanv&#225;ri, nine were transported for life, and the remainder were pardoned. The turbulent villages of Part&#225;bpur and Angar in Kaira were destroyed and the inhabitants removed to more accessible ground in the open country. Their strong position in the ravines of the Mahi river had on several occasions enabled the people of <corr sic="Purt&#225;bpur">Part&#225;bpur</corr> and Angar to set Government at defiance, and this was considered a favourable opportunity of making an example of them and breaking up their stronghold.

 </p><p><note place="margin">And at Lodra.</note>In the meantime information of the gathering at Lodra had reached Major Agar, the Superintendent of Police, Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d.

Maganl&#225;l fled to the north after a slight skirmish in which two men were killed and four wounded, and was captured a few days afterwards by the <hi>Th&#225;nd&#225;r</hi> of Sammu with eleven followers. They were tried by General Roberts and Mr. Hadow, the Collector of Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d, under Act XIV. of 1857. Three of them were blown from guns at Waiz&#225;pur, three were hanged, and the rest were transported for life.

 </p><p>It is much to be regretted that Malh&#225;rr&#225;o G&#225;ikw&#225;r and the Bhonsla R&#225;ja were allowed to escape punishment. There was very clear evidence of the guilt of the Bhonsla R&#225;ja, but His Highness the G&#225;ikw&#225;r interceded for him, and Sir Richmond Shakespeare, the Resident, weakly consented that his life should be spared on condition that he should be imprisoned for life at Baroda, a sentence which, it is hardly necessary to say, was never carried out.

His Highness the G&#225;ikw&#225;r had consented to a simultaneous disarmament of his country, but he evaded the performance of his promise. In the Kaira district and in the Jambusar t&#225;luka of Broach the disarmament was very strictly enforced; every male adult of the fighting classes was required to produce an arm of some kind. The town of Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d was relieved of 20,000 arms in the first two days, but the Highlanders and 86th Regiment were required for operations in <corr sic="Rajput&#225;na">R&#225;jput&#225;na</corr>, and after their departure from Gujar&#225;t it was deemed prudent to postpone this very unpopular measure.

 </p><p><note place="margin">N&#225;ikda Revolt, Oct. 1858.</note>After these events Gujar&#225;t remained tranquil for nearly a year till, in October 1858, the N&#225;ikda Bhils of N&#225;rukot revolted under Rupa and Keval N&#225;iks, and a few months later T&#225;tia Topi&#8217;s scattered force being hard-pressed by Colonel Park&#8217;s column, plundered several villages of the Panch Mah&#225;ls during its rapid march through that district.

 </p><p><note place="margin">T&#225;tia Topi, 1858.</note>In 1858, after his defeat at Gw&#225;lior, at the close of the mutinies in Northern India, T&#225;tia Topi moved rapidly towards the Dakhan. The chiefs of Jamkhandi and N&#225;rgund had been in treasonable correspondence with the rebel chiefs in the North-West and had invoked their aid. It is more than probable that if T&#225;tia Topi had entered the Dakhan in force, there would have been a general insurrection of the Mar&#225;tha population. T&#225;tia&#8217;s march to the Dakhan soon assumed the character of a flight. He was closely pressed by two columns under Generals Somerset and Mitchell, and a very compact and enterprizing little field force commanded by Colonel Park. Colonel Park&#8217;s own regiment, the 72nd Highlanders, many of the men mounted on camels, formed the main fighting power of this force. His indefatigable energy in the pursuit of the enemy allowed them no rest, and eventually brought them to bay at Chhota Udepur. Fearing to face the open country of Ber&#225;r with such an uncompromising enemy in pursuit, T&#225;tia recrossed the Narbada at Chikalda and marched towards Baroda. He had, by means of an agent named Ganpatr&#225;o, for some time been in communication with the Bh&#225;u S&#225;heb Pav&#225;r, a brother-in-law of His Highness the G&#225;ikw&#225;r, and had been led to expect aid from the Baroda Sard&#225;rs and the Th&#225;kors of the Kaira and Rewa K&#225;ntha districts. Immediately it became known that T&#225;tia had crossed the Narbada, troops were put in motion from Kaira, Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d, and Disa for the protection of the eastern frontier of Gujar&#225;t. Captain Thatcher, who had succeeded to the command of the irregular levies raised by Mr. Ashburner in Kaira, was ordered to hold Sankheda with the irregulars and two of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s guns. He was afterwards reinforced by Captain Collier&#8217;s detachment of the 7th Regiment N. I., which fell back from Chhota Udepur on the approach of the enemy.

He had also been joined by a mixed rabble of Vill&#225;yatis, Rohill&#225;s, and R&#225;jputs, who followed his fortune in hopes of plunder. Ferozsha Naw&#225;b of Kamona and a Mar&#225;tha Sard&#225;r who was known as the R&#225;o S&#225;heb, held subordinate commands. Each fighting man was followed by one or more ponies laden with plunder which greatly impeded their movements. It was chiefly owing to this that Colonel Park was enabled to overtake the rebels and to force them into action. On reaching Chhota Udepur the troops of the R&#225;ja fraternised with the enemy, and Captain Collier having evacuated the town, T&#225;tia Topi was allowed to occupy it without opposition. He had intended to halt at Chhota Udepur to recruit his men and to develop his intrigues with the Baroda Sard&#225;rs, but Park gave him no respite. On the 1st December 1858, he fell upon T&#225;tia&#8217;s rebel force and defeated it with great slaughter, his own loss being trifling. After this defeat there was great confusion in the ranks of the insurgents. T&#225;tia Topi abandoned his army and did not rejoin it till it had reached the forest lands of P&#225;rona. Discipline which had always been lax, was now entirely thrown aside. The muster roll of one of T&#225;tia&#8217;s cavalry regiments was picked up and showed that out of a strength of 300 sabres only sixteen were present for duty. The rebel force separated into two bodies, one doubled back and plundered Park&#8217;s baggage which had fallen far to the rear, the other under Ferozsha entered the Panch Mah&#225;ls and looted B&#225;riya, Jh&#225;lod, <corr sic="Lim&#7693;i">Limb&#7693;i</corr>, and other villages; Godhra being covered by Muter&#8217;s force was not attacked. Park&#8217;s force was so disabled by the plunder of its baggage and by long continued forced marches, that it was compelled to halt at Chhota Udepur, but General Somerset took up the pursuit and rapidly drove T&#225;tia from the Panch Mah&#225;ls. He fled in the direction of Salumba. The Th&#225;kor of that place was in arms, and T&#225;tia no doubt expected support from him, but the Th&#225;kor was too cautious to join what was then evidently a hopeless cause. On reaching Nargad on the 20th February 1859, Ferozsha made overtures of surrender, and a week later 300 cavalry and a mixed force of 1500 men under Zahur Ali and the Maulvi Vazir Kh&#225;n laid down their arms to General Mitchell. They were admitted to the benefit of the amnesty. The remnant of T&#225;tia&#8217;s force fled to the north-east.

I. under Captain Bates at J&#225;mbughoda. They were repulsed with considerable loss after a desultory fight during the greater part of two days. On the arrest of Ganpatr&#225;o, the Bh&#225;u S&#225;heb&#8217;s agent, this troublesome insurrection would probably have collapsed, but the Naikd&#225;s were joined by a number of Vill&#225;yatis, matchlock-men, the fragments of T&#225;tia&#8217;s broken force, who encouraged them to hold out. They occupied the very strong country between Ch&#225;mp&#225;ner and N&#225;rukot, and kept up a harassing warfare, plundering the villages as far north as Godhra.

I. was severely wounded by a matchlock bullet on the 28th January 1859. The only success obtained by the N&#225;ikd&#225;s was the surprise of Hassan Ali&#8217;s company of Hussein Kh&#225;n&#8217;s levy. The Subhed&#225;r had been ordered to protect the labourers who were employed in opening the pass near the village of Sivr&#225;jpur, but the duty was very distasteful to him, and his son deserted with twenty-four men on the march to Sivr&#225;jpur. They were suddenly attacked by a mixed force of Makr&#225;nis and N&#225;ikd&#225;s. Seven men including the Subhed&#225;r were killed and eleven wounded without any loss to the enemy. The Subhed&#225;r neglected to protect his camp by the most ordinary precautions and his men appear to have behaved badly. They fled without firing a shot directly they were attacked. But little progress had been made in pacifying the N&#225;ikd&#225;s till Captain Richard Bonner was employed to raise and organize a corps composed chiefly of Bhils with their head-quarters at Dohad in the Panch Mah&#225;ls. Captain Bonner&#8217;s untiring energy and moral influence soon reduced the N&#225;ikd&#225;s to submission. Rupa N&#225;ik laid down his arms and accepted the amnesty of the 10th March 1859, and Keval N&#225;ik followed his example soon after.

 </p><p><note place="margin">W&#225;gher Outbreak, 1859.</note>In July 1859 the W&#225;ghers of Okh&#225;mandal, a mah&#225;l in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a belonging to His Highness the G&#225;ikw&#225;r, suddenly seized and plundered Dw&#225;rka, Barv&#225;la, and Bet. They were led by a W&#225;gher chief named Toda Manik, who alleged that he had been compelled to take up arms by the oppression of the G&#225;ikw&#225;r&#8217;s <hi>k&#225;md&#225;rs</hi>; but it is probable that he was encouraged to throw off allegiance by the weakness of the Baroda administration and the belief that he would have to deal with the troops of the Darb&#225;r only. He soon found he was in error. Major Christie with 200 sabres of the Gujar&#225;t Horse and a wing of the 17th Regiment Native Infantry from R&#225;jkot marched to Mand&#225;na on the Ran to cut off the communication between Okh&#225;mandal and the K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a peninsula. The cantonment of R&#225;jkot was reinforced from Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d by six guns of Aytoun&#8217;s battery, a wing of the 33rd Regiment and a detachment of the 14th Regiment Native Infantry under Captain Hall, and a naval and military force was at the same time prepared in Bombay for the recovery of Bet and Dw&#225;rka as soon as the close of the monsoon should render naval operations on the western coast possible.

Colonel Scobie marched from R&#225;jkot early in October with the wings of Her Majesty&#8217;s 33rd Regiment and 17th Native Infantry, the 12th Light Field Battery and detachments of the 14th Native Infantry and Gujar&#225;t Horse. Had Colonel Donovan waited for this force he might have effectually invested the fort of Bet, which is situated on an island, and exterminated the rebels; but he was too anxious to distinguish himself before he could be relieved of command. He arrived off Bet on the 4th October 1859, and at sunrise that morning the steam-ships <hi>Firoz</hi>, <hi>Zenobia</hi>, <hi>Clyde</hi>, and <hi>Constance</hi> took up their positions off the fort of Bet and opened fire with shot and shell at 950 yards. The fort replied feebly with a few small guns. Shells effectually scorched the fort and temples occupied by the enemy, but the shot made little impression on the wall which was here thirty feet thick. The bombardment continued throughout the day and at intervals during the night. Next morning Dewa Chabasni, the W&#225;gher chief in command of the fort, opened negotiations for surrender, but he would not consent to the unconditional surrender which was demanded, and after an interval of half an hour the artillery fire was resumed and preparations were made to disembark the troops. They landed under a heavy musketry fire from the fort and adjacent buildings, and an attempt was made to escalade. The ladders were placed against the wall but the storming party of Her Majesty&#8217;s 28th Regiment and 6th Regiment Native Infantry were repulsed with heavy loss. Captain McCormack of Her Majesty&#8217;s 28th Regiment, Ensign Willaume of the 6th Regiment, and ten European soldiers were killed; and Captain Glasspoole, Lieutenant Grant of the 6th Native Infantry, and thirty-seven men of the 28th Regiment were wounded, many of them severely. One sepoy of the Marine Battalion was killed and five wounded.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Bet Fort Taken.</note>During the night which succeeded this disastrous attack the W&#225;ghers evacuated the fort. They reached the mainland, taking with them their women the children and the plunder of the temple, but Dewa Chabasni, the W&#225;gher chief, had been killed the previous day. Considering the large and well-equipped force at Colonel Donovan&#8217;s disposal and the facilities which the insular position of Bet afforded to a blockading force, the escape of the W&#225;ghers almost with impunity, encumbered with women and plunder, did not enhance Colonel Donovan&#8217;s military reputation. Captain D. Nasmyth, R. E., Field Engineer of the Okh&#225;mandal Force, was directed to destroy the fort of Bet and carried out his instructions most effectually. Some of the Hindu temples nearest the walls were severely shaken by the explosion of the mines, and a great outcry was raised of the desecration of the temples; but if Hindus will convert their temples into fortified enclosures, they must take the consequence when they are occupied by the enemies of the British Government.

 </p><p>Lieutenant Charles Goodfellow, R. E., greatly distinguished himself on this occasion. He earned the Victoria Cross by carrying <pb id="pb448" n="448"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item><hi rend="sc">Gujar&#225;t Disturbances</hi>, 1857&#8211;1859.</item></list> </fw>off a wounded man of Her Majesty&#8217;s 28th Regiment under a very heavy fire. Treasure valued at 3&#189; l&#225;khs of rupees was taken on board the <hi>Firoz</hi> for safe custody. It was eventually restored to the Puj&#225;ris of the temples, but most of the temples had been carefully plundered by the W&#225;ghers before the entry of the British force.

 </p><p><note place="margin"><corr sic="Dwarka">Dw&#225;rka</corr> Fort Taken.</note>Many of the fugitives from Bet took refuge in Dw&#225;rka, and Colonel Donovan&#8217;s force having re-embarked proceeded to Dw&#225;rka to await the arrival of Colonel Scobie&#8217;s small brigade. Scobie&#8217;s force did not reach Dw&#225;rka till October 20th. The Naval Brigade under Lieutenant Sedley with sixteen officers and 110 men had already landed under very heavy matchlock fire, and thrown up a slight breastwork of loose stone within 150 yards of the walls. A field piece from the <hi>Zenobia</hi> and afterwards a thirty-two pounder were placed in position in this work. The successful result of the siege was mainly due to the determined bravery of this small naval force. They repulsed repeated sorties from the fort and inflicted severe losses on the enemy. As soon as the stores and ammunition could be landed, Colonel Donovan took up a position to the north-east of the fort, Colonel Scobie to the south-east, and Captain Hall occupied an intermediate position with detachments of Her Majesty&#8217;s 33rd Regiment, the 14th Native Infantry, and Gujar&#225;t Horse under Lieutenant Pym. The garrison made several determined attempts to break through Captain Hall&#8217;s position, but they were on each occasion driven back with loss.

 </p><p>The first battery opened fire on the northern face of the fort on October 28th, while the <hi>Zenobia</hi> and the <hi>Firoz</hi> poured a well-directed fire of shells on the houses and temples which sheltered the enemy towards the sea. The shells did immense execution and relieved the attack on the Naval Brigade which continued to hold its position with the greatest gallantry though several times surrounded by the enemy. On the night of the 31st October the garrison evacuated the fort and cut its way through a picket of Her Majesty&#8217;s 28th Regiment, wounding Ensign Hunter and four men. A detachment under Colonel Christie followed the fugitives next morning and overtook them near Vasatri. A skirmish ensued, but they escaped without much loss and took refuge in the Barda hill. They continued to disturb the peace of <corr sic="K&#225;thi&#225;va&#7693;a">K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a</corr> for several years. In one of the desultory skirmishes which followed, Lieutenants LaTouche and Hebbert were killed.

Colonel Evans commanded the field force which was employed against him for many months without any very definite results. The country is a desert and the Sodh&#225;s avoided a collision with the troops. The R&#225;na eventually submitted and peace was restored.

Jackson of the Indian Civil Service.</note> North Latitude 24&#176; 42&#8242; East Longitude 72&#176; 4&#8242;, the historical Shrim&#225;l, the capital of the Gurjjaras from about the sixth to the ninth century, lies about fifty miles west of &#193;bu hill. The site of the city is in a wide plain about fifteen miles west of the last outlier of the &#193;bu range. To the east, between the hills and Bhinm&#225;l, except a few widely-separated village sites, the plain is chiefly a grazing ground with brakes of thorn and cassia bushes overtopped by standards of the camel-loved <hi>pilu</hi> Salvadora persica. To the south, the west, and the north the plain is smooth and bare passing westwards into sand. From the level of the plain stand out a few isolated blocks of hill, 500 to 800 feet high, of which one peak, about a mile west of the city, is crowned by the shrine of Ch&#225;mu&#7751;&#7693;a the &#346;r&#237; or Luck of Bhinm&#225;l. From a distance the present Bhinm&#225;l shows few traces of being the site of an ancient capital. Its 1500 houses cover the gentle slope of an artificial mound, the level of their roofs broken by the spires of four Jain temples and by the ruined state office at the south end of the mound. Closer at hand the number and size of the old stone-stripped tank and fortification mounds and the large areas honeycombed by diggers for bricks show that the site of the present Bhinm&#225;l was once the centre of a great and widespread city. Of its fortifications, which, as late as <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1611, the English merchant Nicholas Ufflet, in a journey from Jh&#225;lor to Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d, describes as enclosing a circuit of thirty-six miles (24 <hi>kos</hi>) containing many fine tanks going to ruin, almost no trace remains.<note id="n449.2" n="2">Finch in Kerr&#8217;s Voyages, VIII. 301. Thirty years later the traveller Tavernier (Ball&#8217;s Edition, II. 87) has: Bargant (Wangam in Jodhpur&#160;?) to Bim&#225;l 15 <hi>kos</hi>: Bim&#225;l to Modra 15 <hi>kos</hi>. Of Jh&#225;lor Ufflet has left the following description. Jh&#225;lor is a castle on the top of a steep mountain three <hi>kos</hi> in ascent by a fair stone causeway broad enough for two men. At the end of the first <hi>kos</hi> is a gate and a place of guard where the causeway is enclosed on both sides with walls. At the end of the second <hi>kos</hi> is a double gate strongly fortified; and at the third <hi>kos</hi> is the castle which is entered by three successive gates. The first is very strongly plated with iron, the second not so strong with places above for throwing down melted lead or boiling oil, and the third is thickly beset with iron spikes. Between each of these gates are spacious places of arms and at the inner gate is a strong portcullis. A bowshot within the castle is a splendid pagoda, built by the founders of the castle and ancestors of Ghazni (Gidney) Kh&#225;n who were Gentiles. He turned Muhammadan and deprived his elder brother of this castle by the following stratagem. Having invited him and his women to a banquet which his brother requited by a similar entertainment he substituted chosen soldiers well armed instead of women, sending them two and two in a <hi>dhuli</hi> or litter who getting in by this device gained possession of the gates and held the place for the Great Mughal to whom it now (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1611) appertains being one of the strongest situated forts in the world. About half a <hi>kos</hi> within the gate is a goodly square tank cut out of the solid rock said to be fifty fathoms deep and full of excellent water. Quoted by Finch in Kerr&#8217;s Voyages, VIII. 300&#8211;301.</note> The names of some of the old gates are remembered, Surya in the north-east, &#346;r&#237; Lakshm&#237; in the south-east, Sanchor in the west, and Jh&#225;lor in the north.

Rattan Lal Pandit.</note> Besides these outlying gateways traces remain round the foot of the present Bhinm&#225;l mound of a smaller and later wall. To the east and south the line of fortification has been so cleared of masonry and is so confused with the lines of tank banks, which perhaps were worked into the scheme of defence, that all accurate local knowledge of their position has passed. The Gujar&#225;t gate in the south of the town though ruined is well marked. From the Gujar&#225;t gateway a line of mounds may be traced south and then west to the ruins of Pipalduara perhaps the western gateway. The wall seems then to have turned east crossing the watercourse and passing inside that is along the east bank of the watercourse north to the south-west corner of the Jaikop or Yaksha lake. From this corner it ran east along the south bank of Jaikop to the Jh&#225;lor or north gate which still remains in fair preservation its pointed arch showing it to be of Musalm&#225;n or late (17th&#8211;18th century) R&#225;htor construction. From the Jh&#225;lor gate the foundations of the wall may be traced east to the Kanaksen or Kar&#225;da tank. The area to the east of the town from the Kar&#225;da tank to the Gujar&#225;t gate has been so quarried for brick to build the present Bhinm&#225;l that no sign remains of a line of fortifications running from the Kar&#225;da tank in the east to the Gujar&#225;t gate in the south.

 </p><p>The site of the present town the probable centre of the old city, is a mound stretching for about three-quarters of a mile north and south and swelling twenty to thirty feet out of the plain. On almost all sides its outskirts are protected by well made thorn fences enclosing either garden land or the pens and folds of Rab&#225;ris and Bh&#237;ls. The streets are narrow and winding. The dwellings are of three classes, the flat mud-roofed houses of the Mah&#225;jans or traders and of the better-to-do Br&#225;hmans and craftsmen with canopied doors and fronts plastered with white clay: Second the tiled sloping-roofed sheds of the bulk of the craftsmen and gardeners and of the better-off Rab&#225;ris and Bh&#237;ls: and Third the thatched bee-hive huts of the bulk of the Rab&#225;ris and Bh&#237;ls and of some of the poorer craftsmen and husbandmen. Especially to the north-west and west the houses are skirted by a broad belt of garden land. In other parts patches of watered crops are separated by the bare banks of old tanks or by stretches of plain covered with thorn and cassia bushes or roughened by the heaps of old buildings honeycombed by shafts sunk by searchers for bricks. Besides the four spired temples to P&#225;rasn&#225;th the only outstanding building is the old <hi>kacheri</hi> or state office a mass of ruins which tops the steep south end of the city mound.

Osw&#225;ls, almost all of whom are Shr&#225;vaks or followers of the Jain religion, have practically spread from Bhinm&#225;l. The origin of the name Osv&#225;l is (Trans. Roy. As. Soc. III. 337) from Osi the Mother or Luck of Osianagar an ancient town and still a place of pilgrimage about eighteen miles north of Jodhpur. The Osw&#225;ls were originally <corr sic="Rajputs">R&#225;jputs</corr> of several classes including Paw&#225;rs but mainly Solan&#775;kis and so apparently (Tod&#8217;s Western India, 209) of Gurjjara origin. Equally of Gurjjara origin are the Shrim&#225;li V&#225;nis who hold a specially high place among Western Indian Jains. The care taken by the Jains to secure foreign conquerors within their fold is notable. The Tirthankar is a R&#225;ja who by piety and other virtues attained <hi>moksha</hi> or absorption. The fifty-four worshipfuls <hi>uttamapurushas</hi>, the twenty-four <hi>tirthankars</hi>, the twelve <hi>chakravartis</hi>, the nine <hi>b&#225;ladevas</hi>, and the nine <hi>v&#225;sudevas</hi> are R&#225;j&#225;s, most of them great conquerors (Trans.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Objects. <lb/><hi>In the Town.</hi></note>Inside of the town the objects of interest are few. The four temples of P&#225;rasn&#225;th are either modern or altered by modern repairs. A rest-house to the south of a temple of Bar&#225;gi or Var&#225;ha the Boar in the east of the town has white marble pillars with inscriptions of the eleventh and thirteenth centuries which show that the pillars have been brought from the ruined temple of the sun or Jag Sv&#225;mi Lord of the World on the mound about eighty yards east of the south or modern Gujar&#225;t gate. In the west of the town, close to the wall of the enclosure of the old Mah&#225;lakshmi temple, is a portion of a white marble pillar with an <pb id="pb452" n="452"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix III.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Bhinm&#225;l.</hi></item><item>Objects.</item></list> </fw>inscription dated <abbr>S.</abbr> 1342 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1286) which apparently has been brought from the same ruined sun temple. In the <hi>kacheri</hi> ruins at the south end of the mound the only object of interest is a small shrine to M&#225;ta with two snakes supporting her seat and above in modern characters the words N&#225;g&#225;ne the <hi>kuldevi</hi> or tribe guardian of the R&#225;htors.

 </p><p><note place="margin"><hi>Surroundings.</hi></note>The chief object of interest at Bhinm&#225;l is the ruined temple of the Sun on a mound close to the south of the town. Of this temple and its inscriptions details are given below. About fifty yards west of the Sun temple are the remains of a gateway known as the Gujar&#225;t gateway. This modern name and the presence near it of blocks of the white quartz-marble of the Sun temple make it probable that the gateway is not older than Musalm&#225;n or eighteenth century R&#225;htor times. Close to the west of the gate is Kh&#225;ri B&#225;va the Salt Well an old step and water-bag well with many old stones mixed with brick work. About a hundred yards south of the Gujar&#225;t gate, in a brick-walled enclosure about sixteen yards by eight and nine feet high topped by a shield parapet, is the shrine of Mah&#225;deva Naul&#225;kheshwar. An inscription dated <abbr>S.</abbr> 1800 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1744) states that the enclosure marks the site of an old temple to Naul&#225;kheshwar. About fifty yards east of the Naul&#225;kheshwar shrine is a large brick enclosure about seventy-five yards square with walls about twelve feet high and a pointed-arched gateway in the Moslim wave-edged style. On entering, to the left, is a plinth with a large Hanum&#225;n and further to the left in domed shrines are a Ganpati and a M&#225;ta. A few paces south is Brahma&#8217;s Pool or Brahmakhund with steep steps on the west and north, a rough stone and brick wall to the east, and a circular well to the south. The pool walls and steps have been repaired by stones taken from Hindu temples or from former decorations of the pool on some of which are old figures of Mat&#225;s in good repair. The story is that Som, according to one account the builder of the Sun temple according to another account a restorer of Shrim&#225;l, wandering in search of a cure for leprosy, came to the south gate of Shrim&#225;l. Som&#8217;s dog which was suffering from mange disappeared and soon after appeared sound and clean. The king traced the dog&#8217;s footmarks to the Brahmakhund, bathed in it, and was cured. As a thank-offering he surrounded the pool with masonry walls. To the south of the pool, to the right, are an underground <hi>lin&#775;g</hi> sacred to Pat&#225;leshwar the lord of the Under World and south of the <hi>lin&#775;g</hi> a small domed shrine of Chandi Devi. To the left, at the east side of a small brick enclosure is a snake-canopied <hi>lin&#775;g</hi> known as Chandeshwar hung about with strings of <hi>rudr&#225;ksh</hi> <foreign lang="la-x-bio" xml:lang="la-x-bio">El&#230;ocarpus ganitrus</foreign> beads.<note id="n452.1" n="1">According to a local story there was a hermitage of Jangams near the temple of Jagamdeva the Sun-God and a hermitage of Bharatis near Chandeshvar&#8217;s shrine. In a fight between the rival ascetics many were slain and the knowledge where their treasure was stored passed away. When repairs were made in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1814 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1870) the Bharati hermitage was cleared. Two large earthen pots were found one of which still stands at the door of Chandeshvar&#8217;s temple. These pots contained the treasure of the Bharatis. In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1814 nothing but white dust was found. Most of the dust was thrown away till a Jain ascetic came and examined the white dust. The ascetic called for an iron rod, heated the rod, sprinkled it with the white dust, and the iron became gold.</note> In front of Chandeshwar&#8217;s shrine is a small inscribed stone with at its top a cow and calf recording a land grant to Shrim&#225;li Br&#225;hmans. About forty yards north-east of the Brahmakhund a large straggling heap of brick and earth, now known as Laksham&#237;thala or Lakshm&#237;&#8217;s settlement, is said to be the site of a temple to Lakshm&#237; built, according to the local <pb id="pb453" n="453"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix III.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Bhinm&#225;l.</hi></item><item>Objects.</item><item><hi>Surroundings.</hi></item></list> </fw>legend, by a Br&#225;hman to whom in return for his devotedness Lakshm&#237; had given great wealth. The hollow to the south-east is known as the Khand&#225;lia pool. About fifty yards south-east at the end of a small enclosure is a shrine and cistern of Jageshwar, said to be called after a certain Jag who in return for the gift of a son built the temple. Several old carved and dressed stones are built into the walls of this temple. About seventy-five yards further south-east a large area rough with heaps of brick is said to be the site of an old Vidhya-S&#225;la or Sanskrit College. This college is mentioned in the local Mah&#225;tmya as a famous place of learning the resort of scholars from distant lands.<note id="n453.1" n="1">According to Alberuni (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1030) the Brahmasiddh&#225;nta was composed by Brahmagupta the son of Jishnu from the town of Bhillam&#225;la between Mult&#225;n and Anhilw&#225;ra. Sachau&#8217;s Translation, I. 153. Another light of the college was the Sanskrit poet Magha, the son of <corr sic="Srim&#225;li">&#346;r&#237;m&#225;l&#237;</corr> parents, who is said to have lived in the time of Bhoj R&#225;ja of Ujjain (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1010&#8211;1040). M&#225;rw&#225;r Castes, 68.</note> The local account states that as the Bhils grew too powerful the Br&#225;hmans were unable to live in the college and retired to Dholka in north Gujar&#225;t.

 </p><p>The slope and skirts of the town beyond the thorn-fenced enclosures of Bhils and Rab&#225;ris lie in heaps honeycombed with holes hollowed by searchers for bricks. Beyond this fringe of fenced enclosures from a half to a whole mile from the city are the bare white banks of pools and tanks some for size worthy to be called lakes. Of these, working from the south northwards, the three chief are the Nimb&#225;li or Narmukhsarovar, the Goni or Gayakund, and the Talbi or Trambaksarovar. The Nimb&#225;li tank, about 300 yards south-east of the college site, is a large area opening eastwards whence it draws its supply of water and enclosed with high bare banks scattered with bricks along the south-west and north. The lake is said to be named <corr sic="Nimbali">Nimb&#225;li</corr> after a V&#225;ni to whom Mah&#225;deva granted a son and for whom Mah&#225;deva formed the hollow of the lake by ploughing it with his thunderbolt. About half a mile north-east of Nimb&#225;li a horseshoe bank fifteen to thirty feet high, except to the open east, is the remains of the Goni lake. Lines of stone along the foot of the north-west and north-east banks shew that portions at least of these sides were once lined with masonry. A trace of steps remains at a place known as the Gau Gh&#225;t or Cowgate. The lake is said to have been named Goni after a Br&#225;hman whose parents being eaten by a R&#225;kshas went to hell. For their benefit Goni devoted his life to the worship of <corr sic="Vishnu">Vish&#7751;u</corr> and built a temple and lake. In reward <corr sic="Vishnu">Vish&#7751;u</corr> gave to the water of the lake the merit or cleansing virtue of the water of G&#225;ya. In the foreground a row of small <hi>chatris</hi> or pavilions marks the burying ground of the Mahajan or high Hindu community of Bhinm&#225;l. Behind the pavilions are the bare banks of the Talbi lake. At the west end is the Bomb&#225;ro well and near the south-west is the shrine of Tr&#237;mbakeshvar Mah&#225;dev. This lake is said to have been made in connection with a great sacrifice or <hi>yag</hi>, that is <hi>yajna</hi>, held by Br&#225;hmans to induce or to compel the god Trimbakeshwar to slay the demon Tripur&#225;sur. Beginning close to the south of Talbi lake and stretching north-west towards the city is the Kar&#225;d&#225; Sarovar or Kar&#225;d&#225; lake said to have been built by Kanaksen or Kanishka the great founder of the Skythian era (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;78). On the western bank of the lake stands an open air <hi>lin&#775;g</hi> of Karaiteshwar.<note id="n453.2" n="2">The local account explains the origin of the name Kanak which also means gold by the story of a Bhil who was drowned on the waxing fifth of Bh&#225;darwa. The Bhil&#8217;s wife who was with him failing to drown herself prepared a funeral pyre. Mah&#225;deva pleased with the woman&#8217;s devotion restored her husband to life and made his body shine like gold. As a thankoffering the Bhil enlarged the tank and built a shrine to Kirait Mah&#225;deva.</note> At the south end of the Kar&#225;d&#225; <pb id="pb454" n="454"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix III.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Bhinm&#225;l.</hi></item><item>Objects.</item><item><hi>Surroundings.</hi></item></list> </fw>lake, which stretches close to the fenced enclosures round the city, are the remains of a modern bastion and of a wall which runs north-west to the Jh&#225;lor gate. Beyond the site of the bastion is an enclosure and shrine of Maheshwar Mah&#225;dev. To the north and north-west of the Karait sea lie four large tanks. Of these the most eastern, about 300 yards north-west of Kar&#225;d&#225;, is Brahmasarovar a large area fed from the north and with high broken banks. Next, about 500 yards north-west, lies the far-stretching V&#225;nkund or Forest Pool open to the north-east. About 800 yards west is Gautam&#8217;s tank which holds water throughout the year. The banks of brick and <hi>kankar</hi> form nearly a complete circle except at the feeding channels in the east and south. In the centre of the lake is an islet on which are the white-stone foundations (18&#8242; &#215; 12&#8242;) of Gautam&#8217;s hermitage. On the bank above the east feeding-channel is an image of Hanum&#225;n and on the east side of the southern channel at the foot of the bank is a white inscribed stone with letters so worn that nothing but the date <abbr>S.</abbr> 1106 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1049) has been made out. Of the balls of <hi>kankar</hi> or nodular limestone which are piled into the bank of the tank those which are pierced with holes are lucky and are kept to guard wooden partitions against the attacks of insects. The last and westmost of the north row of tanks is the Jaikop properly Jakshkop that is the Yaksha&#8217;s Pool about 600 yards south-west of the Gautam tank and close to the north-west of the town.<note id="n454.1" n="1">The local explanation of the name Yaksha&#8217;s Pool is that R&#225;vana went to Abaka the city of the great Yaksha Kuvera god of wealth and stole Pushpak Kuvera&#8217;s <hi>vim&#225;n</hi> or carrier. Kuvera in sorrow asked his father what he should do to recover his carrier. The father said Worship in Shrim&#225;l. Kuvera came to Shrim&#225;l and worshipped Brahma who appeared to him and said: When R&#225;mchandra destroys Ravana he will bring back Pushpak.</note> This tank holds water throughout the year and supplies most of the town&#8217;s demand. Along the south bank of the Jaikop, where are tombs<corr>,</corr> a shrine to Bhairav and a ruined mosque, the line of the later city walls used to run. At the south-east corner of the tank are three square masonry plinths each with a headstone carved with the figure of a man or woman. One of the plinths which is adorned with a pillared canopy has a stone carved with a man on horseback and a standing woman in memory of a Tehsildar of Bhinm&#225;l of recent date (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1869; <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1812) whose wife became <hi>Sati</hi>. About 200 yards south-east is a row of white <hi>p&#225;lia</hi> or memorial slabs of which the third from the south end of the row is dated <abbr>S.</abbr> 1245 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1186). On the south-east bank is the shrine of Nimghoria Bhairav at which Shr&#225;vaks as well as other Hindus worship. In the centre of the shrine is a leaning pillar about five feet high with four fronts, Hanum&#225;n on the east, a standing Snake on the south, a <corr sic="Sakti">&#346;akti</corr> on the west, and Bhairav on the north. To the south of the pillar, about a foot out of the ground rises a five-faced <hi>lin&#775;g</hi> or pillar-home of the god one facing each quarter of the heaven and one uncarved facing the sky. Close to a well within the circuit of the lake near the south-east corner is a stone inscribed with letters which are too worn to be read. At the east end of the north bank under a <hi>pilu</hi> Salvadora persica tree is a massive seated figure still worshipped and still dignified though the features have been broken off, and the left lower arm and leg and both feet have disappeared. This is believed to be the image of the Yaksha king who made the tank. Details are given Below pages 456&#8211;458. To the west of the seated statue are the marks of the foundations of a temple, shrine hall and outer hall, which is believed to have originally been the shrine of Yaksh. About a hundred yards west, under a pillared canopy of white quartz, are two Musalm&#225;n <pb id="pb455" n="455"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix III.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Bhinm&#225;l.</hi></item><item>Objects.</item><item><hi>Surroundings.</hi></item></list> </fw>graves in honour of Ghazni Kh&#225;n and Ham&#225;l Kh&#225;n who were killed about 400 years ago at Jh&#225;lor fighting for Shrim&#225;l. In obedience to their dying request their Bh&#225;ts brought the champions&#8217; bodies to Yaksh&#8217;s tank. The white quartz, the shape of the pillars, and an inscription on one of them dated <abbr>S.</abbr> 1333 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1276), go to show that the stones have been brought from the Sun temple to the south of the town. To the north of the canopy is a large step-well the Dadeli Well separated into an outer and an inner section by a row of Hindu pillars supporting flat architraves. Some of the stones have figures of goddesses and in a niche is an old goddess&#8217; image. The upper part of the well and the parapet are of recent brick work. On a low mound about 150 yards to the north is the shrine of Nilkanth M&#225;h&#225;dev, with, about a hundred paces to the south-east, a fine old step-well. The lake was fed from the south-west corner where is a silt trap built of stones in many cases taken from old temples and carved with the <hi>chaitya</hi> or horse-shoe ornament. Some of the stones have apparently been brought from the great white quartz Sun temple. Several of them have a few letters of the fourteenth century character apparently the names of masons or carvers. Some of the blocks are of a rich red sandstone which is said to be found only in the Rupe quarries eight miles south of Bhinm&#225;l.

 </p><p>On the right, about half a mile south of the south-west corner of the Jaikop lake, is a ruined heap hid among trees called the Pipal Du&#225;ra or Gateway perhaps the remains of the western Gateway which may have formed part of the later line of fortifications which can be traced running south along the inner bank of the Jaikop feeding channel. About a mile south of the Pipal Du&#225;ra are the bare banks of the large lake Bansarovar the Desert Sea. To the north-west north and north-east its great earthen banks remain stripped of their masonry gradually sloping to the west and south the direction of its supply of water. The island in the centre is Lakh&#225;ra. This lake was made by Gauri or P&#225;rvati when she came from Sunda hill to slay the female demon Uttamiy&#225;r. When P&#225;rvati killed the demon she piled over her body Shri&#8217;s hill which she had brought with her to form a burial mound. At the same time P&#225;rvati scooped the tank, and crowned Shri&#8217;s hill with a tower-like temple. This hill, where lives the &#346;r&#237; or Luck of Shrim&#225;l, rises 500 feet out of the plain about a mile west of the town. It is approached from the south by a flight of unhewn stones roughly laid as steps. The hill-top is smoothed into a level pavement of brick and cement. The pavement is supported on the east side by a lofty bastion-like wall. It is surrounded by a parapet about two feet high. On the platform two shrines face eastwards. To the left or south is the main temple of Lakshm&#237; and to the right or north the smaller shrine of Su&#7751;&#7693;a M&#225;ta. The main shrine has a porch with pillars and shield frieze of white quartz limestone apparently spoils of the great Sun Temple. Three or four bells hang from the roof of the porch and some loose white stones apparently also from the Sun temple are scattered about. In the west wall of the main shrine facing east is the image of the Guardian of Bhinm&#225;l covered with red paint and gold leaf. The only trace of ornament on the outside of Lakshm&#237;&#8217;s shrine is in the north-face portion of a belt of the horse-shoe or <hi>chaitya</hi> pattern and a disc perhaps the disc of the Sun. The smaller shrine of Su&#7751;&#7693;a M&#225;ta to the right or north is square and flat-roofed. The ceiling is partly made of carved stones apparently prepared for, perhaps formerly the centre slabs of domes. The door posts and lintels are of white quartz marble. On the right door post are two short inscriptions of <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1612 and 1664 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 1669 and 1691).

The roof is supported by four square central pillars which with eight wall pilasters form four shallow domes with lotus carved roof-stones from some other or some older temple. In a recess in the west wall, surmounted with a stone carved in the <hi>chaitya</hi> or horse-shoe pattern, is the Trident or <hi>Trisula</hi> of Su&#7751;&#7693;a M&#225;ta the only object of worship.

 </p><p>From the hill-top the mound of Bhinm&#225;l hardly seems to stand out of the general level. The mound seems hidden in trees. Only in the south gleam the white pillars of the Sun Temple and to the north rise the high mound of the old offices, and still further north the spires of the four temples of <corr sic="Parasn&#225;th">P&#225;rasn&#225;th</corr>. Beyond the town to the south and west spread green gardens fenced with dry thorn hedges. Outside of the garden enclosures to the south-east south and south-west run the lofty bare banks of dry lakes confused in places with the lines of old fortifications. To the north-west and north shine the waters of the Jaikop and Gautam tanks. Westwards the plain, dark with thorn brake and green with acacias, stretches to the horizon. On other sides the sea-like level of the plain is broken by groups of hills the Borta range along the north and north-east and to the east the handsomer Ratan&#225;gar, Thur, and Ram Sen rising southwards to the lofty clear-cut ranges of Do&#7693;ala and Su&#7751;&#7693;a.

 </p><p>Only two objects of interest in Bhinm&#225;l require special description, the massive broken statue of the Jaksha or Yaksha on the north bank of the Jaikop lake, and the temple to Jagsv&#225;mi the Sun at the south-east entrance to the city.

The holding a head in his hand suggests that he may have been a guardian Bhairav in some Buddhist temple and so remembered as a guardian or Yaksha. Or he may have been supposed to be a statue of the builder of the temple and so have been called a Yaksha since that word was used for a race of skilful architects and craftsmen. Troyer&#8217;s Rajataran&#775;g&#237;n&#237;, I. 369. In the Vrijji temples in Tirhut which Buddhist accounts make older than Buddhism the objects of worship were ancestral spirits who were called Yakshas. If the Buddhist legends of &#346;aka settlements in Tirhut during Gautama&#8217;s lifetime (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;540) have any historical value these Vrijjis were &#346;akas.

This would explain why the mythic Yaksha was a guardian, a builder, and a white horseman.

Vol. VI. page 170; Heeley in Indian Antiquary, IV. 101). It further explains how the name came to be applied to the Yuechi or Kush&#225;ns who like the Yavanas were guardians white horsemen and builders.

The nose and mouth are broken off, half of the right hand and the whole of the left hand and leg are gone and the feet and almost the whole of the seat or throne have disappeared.

The head is massive.

The face is broken flat. It seems to have been clean shaved or at least beardless. A heavy ring hangs from each ear. A stiff collar-like band encircles the neck and strings of beads or plates hang on the chest too worn to be distinguished. On both arms are upper armlets, a centre lion-face still showing clear on the left armlet. On the right hand is a bracelet composed of two outer bands and a central row of beads. A light belt encircles the waist. Lower down are the <hi>kandora</hi> or hip girdle and the <hi>kopul</hi> or <hi>dhotar</hi> knot.<note id="n457.1" n="1">The measurements are: Height 4&#8242;; head round the brow to behind the ear the back of the head not being cut free, 2&#8242; 6&#8243;; height of head-dress, 8&#8243;; length of face, 10&#8243;; length of ringlets or wig curls from the crown of the head, 2&#8242;; breadth of face, 9&#8243;; across the shoulders, 2&#8242; 3&#8243;; throat to waistband, 1&#8242;; waistband to loose hip-belt or <hi>kandora</hi>, 1&#8242; 3&#8243;; right shoulder to elbow, 1&#8242;; elbow to wrist, 9&#8243;; head in the right hand 5&#8243; high 7&#8243; across top; hip to broken knee, 1&#8242;; knee to ankle, 1&#8242; 5&#8243;; foot broken off. Left shoulder to broken upper arm, 8&#8243;; left leg broken off leaving a fracture which shows it was drawn back like the right leg.</note> In spite of its featureless face and its broken hands and feet the figure has considerable dignity. The head is well set and the curls and diadem are an effective ornament. The chest and the full rounded belly are carved with skill. The main fault in proportion, the overshortened lower arm and leg and the narrowness of the throne, are due to the want of depth in the stone. The chief details of interest are the figure&#8217;s head-dress and the ball of stone in its right hand. The head-dress seems to be a wig with a row of crisp round curls across the brow and four lines of long curls hanging down to the shoulders and crisp curls on the top of the head. The <hi>mukut</hi> or diadem has three upright faces, a front face over the nose and side faces over the ears joined together by two rounded bands. At first sight the stone ball in the right hand seems a cocoanut which the king might hold in dedicating the lake. Examination shows on the left side of the ball an outstanding semicircle very like a human ear. Also that above the ear are three rolls as if turban folds. And that the right ear may be hid either by the end of the turban drawn under the chin or by the fingers of the half-closed hand. That the front of the ball has been wilfully smashed further supports the view that it was its human features that drew upon it the Muslim mace. The local Br&#225;hmans contend that the ball is either a round sweetmeat or a handful of mud held in the right hand of the king during the dedication service. But Tappa a Br&#225;hm-Bh&#225;t, a man of curiously correct information, was urgent that the stone ball is a human head. Tappa gives the following tale to explain why the king should hold a human head in his hand. An evil spirit called Satka had been wasting the Br&#225;hmans by carrying off the head of each bridegroom so soon as a wedding ceremony was completed. The king vowed that by the help of his goddess Chamu&#7751;&#7693;a he would put a stop to this evil. The marriage of a hundred Br&#225;hman couples was arranged for one night. The king sat by. So long as the king remained awake the demon dared not appear. When the hundredth marriage was being performed the king gave way to sleep. Satka dashed in and carried off the last bridegroom&#8217;s head. The girl-bride awoke the king and said I will curse you. You watched for the others, for me you did not watch. The king said to his Luck Chamu&#7751;&#7693;a, What shall I do. Chamu&#7751;&#7693;a said Ride after Satka. The king rode after Satka. He overtook her fourteen miles out of Shrim&#225;l and killed her. But before her <pb id="pb458" n="458"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix III.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Bhinm&#225;l.</hi></item><item>Objects.</item><item><hi>Jaikop.</hi></item></list> </fw>death Satka had eaten the bridegroom&#8217;s head. What is to be done the king asked Chamu&#7751;&#7693;a. Trust me said his guardian. The king rode back to Shrim&#225;l. As he was entering the city the goddess pointed out to him a gardener or M&#225;li and said <corr sic="Off">off</corr> with his head. The king obeyed. The goddess caught the falling head, stuck it to the bridegroom&#8217;s neck, and the bridegroom came to life. Thus, ends the tale, the local Br&#225;hmans are known as Shrim&#225;lis that is men with gardeners&#8217; heads. This meaning-making pun and the likeness of the stone-ball to a human head may be the origin of this story. On the other hand the story may be older than the image and may be the reason why the king is shown holding a human head in his hand. On the whole it seems likely that the story was made to explain the image and that the image is a Bhairav holding the head of a human sacrifice and acting as gatekeeper or guardian of some Buddhist or Sun-worshipping temple.<note id="n458.1" n="1">The Jains call the guardian figures at S&#225;nchi Bhairavas.

A connection between Bhairav and the Sun is shown by the practice among Ajmir Gujar women of wearing round the neck a medal of Bhairava before marriage and of the Sun after marriage.</note> The appearance of the figure, its massive well-proportioned and dignified pose, and the long wiglike curls, like the bag wig on the figure of Ch&#225;nd on the south-west or marriage compartment of the great Elephanta Cave, make it probable that this statue is the oldest relic of Shrim&#225;l, belonging like the Elephanta wigged figures to the sixth or early seventh century the probable date of the founding or refounding of the city by the Gurjjar&#225;s.<note id="n458.2" n="2">The Egyptians Romans and Parthians are the three chief wig-wearers.

The brick mound which is crowned by the white marble pillars and the massive laterite ruins of the temple of Jagsv&#225;mi Lord of the World has been so dug into that its true form and size cannot be determined. The size of many of the bricks 1&#8242; 16&#8243; &#215; 1&#8242; &#215; 3&#8243; suggests that the mound is older even than the massive laterite masonry of the shrine. And that here as at Mult&#225;n about the sixth century during the supremacy of the sun-worshipping White H&#250;&#7751;as a temple of the Sun was raised on the ruins of a Buddhist temple or relic mound. Still except the doubtful evidence of the size of the bricks nothing has been found to support the theory that the Sun temple stands on an earlier Buddhist ruin. The apparent present dimensions of the mound are 42&#8242; broad 60&#8242; long and 20&#8242; high. Of the temple the north side and north-west corner are fairly complete. The east entrance to the hall, the south pillars of the hall, and with them the hall dome and the outer wall of the temple round the south and west of the shrine have disappeared. A confused heap of bricks on the top of the shrine and of the entrance from the hall to the shrine is all that is left of the spire and upper buildings. The materials used are of three kinds. The pillars of the hall are of a white quartzlike marble; the masonry of the shrine walls and of the passage round the north of the shrine is of a reddish yellow laterite, and the interior of the spire and apparently some other roof buildings are of brick. Beginning from the original east entrance the ground has been cut away so close to the temple and so many of the pillars have fallen that almost no trace of the entrance is left. The first masonry, entering from the east, are the two eastern pillars of the hall dome and to the north of this central pair the pillar that supported the north-eastern corner of the dome. Except the lowest rim, on the east side, all trace of the dome and of the roof over the dome are gone. The centre of the hall is open to the sky. The south side is even more ruined than the east side. The whole outer wall has fallen and been removed. The south-east corner the two south pillars of the dome and the south-west corner pillars are gone. The north side is better preserved. The masonry that rounds off the corners from which the dome sprung remains and along the rim of the north face runs a belt of finely carved female figures. The north-east corner pillar, the two north pillars of the dome, and the north-west corner pillar all remain. Outside of the pillars runs a passage about four feet broad and eleven feet high, and, beyond the passage, stands the north wall of the temple with an outstanding deep-eaved window balcony with white marble seats and backs and massive pillars whose six feet shafts are in three sections square eightsided and round and on whose double-disc capitals rest brackets which support a shallow cross-cornered dome. At its west end the north passage is ornamented with a rich <hi>gokla</hi> or recess 3&#189; broad with side pillars 3&#188; feet high. On the west side of the dome the central pair of dome pillars and as has been noticed the north corner pillar remain. About three feet west of the west pair of dome pillars a second pair support the domed entrance to the shrine. The richly carved side pillars, a goddess with fly-flap bearers, and the lintel of the shrine door remain but the bare square chamber of the shrine is open to the sky. To the south of the shrine the entire basis of the south side of the spire, the outer circling or <hi>pradakshana</hi> passage and the outer wall of the temple have disappeared. The north side is much less ruinous. There remain <pb id="pb460" n="460"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix III.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Bhinm&#225;l.</hi></item><item>Sun Temple.</item></list> </fw>the massive blocks of yellow and red trap which formed the basis of the spire built in horizontal bands of deep-cut cushions, and in the centre of the north wall a niche with outstanding pillared frame, the circling passage with walls of plain trap and roof of single slabs laid across and the outer wall of the temple with bracket capitaled pillars and a central deep-eaved and pillared hanging window of white marble. The circling passage and the outer wall of the temple end at the north-west corner. Of the western outer wall all trace is gone. The pillars of the temple are massive and handsome with pleasantly broken outline, a pedestal, a square, an eightsided band, a sixteensided band, a round belt, a narrow band of horned faces, the capital a pair of discs, and above the discs outstanding brackets each ending in a crouching four-armed male or female human figure upholding the roof. The six central dome pillars resemble the rest except that instead of the sixteensided band the inner face is carved into an urn from whose mouth overhang rich leafy festoons and which stand on a roll of cloth or a ring of cane such as women set between the head and the waterpot.<note id="n460.1" n="1">The ten feet of the pillars are thus divided: pedestal 2&#8242;, square block 2&#8242;, eightsided belt 18&#8243;, sixteensided belt 18&#8243;, round band 2&#8242;, horned face belt 6&#8243;, double disc capital 6&#8243;.</note> On the roof piles of bricks show that besides the spire some building rose over the central dome and eastern entrance but of its structure nothing can now be traced.

Surya was so pleased by the fervour of Yayati&#8217;s devotion that he appeared before him and asked Yayati to name a boon. Yayati said May I with god-like vision see thee in thy true form. The Sun granted this wish and told Yayati to name a second boon. Yayati said I am weary of ruling and of the pleasures of life. My one wish is that for the good of Shrim&#225;lpur you may be present here in your true form. The Sun agreed. An image was set up in the Sun&#8217;s true form (apparently meaning in a human form) and a Hariya Br&#225;hman was set over it.<note id="n460.3" n="3">Hariya Br&#225;hman is said to mean a descendant of Hariyaji, a well known Br&#225;hman of Shrim&#225;l, so rich that he gave every member of his caste a present of brass vessels.</note> The God said Call me Jagat-Sv&#225;mi the Lord of the World for I am its only protector.

When Jagsom halted at the south gate of Bhinm&#225;l in the course of a pilgrimage from K&#225;shm&#237;r to Dw&#225;rka, he fell asleep and the snake came out at his mouth. At the same time a snake issued from a hole close to the city gate and said to the king&#8217;s belly snake &#8216;You should depart and cease to afflict the king.&#8217; &#8216;There is a fine treasure in your hole&#8217; said the belly snake. &#8216;How would you like to leave it?

If some leaves of the <hi>kir</hi> Capparis aphylla tree are plucked and mixed with the flowers of a creeper that grows under it and boiled and given to the king the snake inside him will be killed.&#8217; &#8216;If any servant of the king is near&#8217; retorted the king&#8217;s snake &#8216;let him hearken. If boiling oil is poured down the hole of the gate-snake the snake will perish and great treasure will be found.&#8217; A clever Kayasth of the king&#8217;s retinue was near and took notes. He found the <hi>kir</hi> tree and the creeper growing under it: he prepared the medicine and gave it to the king. The writhing of the snake caused the king so much agony that he ordered the Kayasth to be killed. Presently the king became sick and the dead snake was thrown up through the king&#8217;s mouth. The king mourned for the dead Kayasth. So clever a man, he said, must have made other good notes. They examined the Kayasth&#8217;s note book, poured the boiling oil down the hole, killed the gate-snake, and found the treasure. To appease the Kayasths and the two snakes l&#225;khs were spent in feeding Br&#225;hmans. With the rest a magnificent temple was built to the Sun and an image duly enshrined. Nine upper stories were afterwards added by Vishvakarma.

In the Satyayug Shrim&#225;l or Shrinagar had 84 Chandis; 336 Kshetrap&#225;ls; 27 Var&#225;has; 101 Sury&#225;s; 51 M&#225;t&#225;s; 21 Brehispatis; 300 to 11,000 Lin&#775;gas; 88,000 Rushis; 999 Wells and Tanks; and 3&#190; krors of <hi>tirthas</hi> or holy places. At first the plain of Bhinm&#225;l was sea and Bhraghurishi called on Surya and the sun dried the water and made it land. Then Braghu started a hermitage and the saints Kashy&#225;p, Atri, Baradwaj, Gautam, J&#225;mdagni, Vishvamitra, and Vashista came from &#193;bu to interview Braghu. Gautam was pleased with the land to the north of Braghu&#8217;s hermitage and prayed Trimbakeshwar that the place might combine the holiness of all holy places and that he and his wife Ahilya might live there in happiness. The God granted the sage&#8217;s prayer. A lake was formed and in the centre an island was raised on which Gautam built his hermitage the foundations of which may still be seen. The channel which feeds Gautam&#8217;s lake from the north-east was cut by an ascetic Br&#225;hman named Yajanasila and in the channel a stone is set with writing none of which but the date <abbr>S.</abbr> 1117 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1060) is legible. Some years after Gautam had settled at Shrim&#225;l a daughter named Lakshm&#237; was born in the house of the sage Braghu. When the girl came of age Braghu consulted Naradji about a husband. When Naradji saw Lakshm&#237;, he said; This girl can be the wife of no one but of <corr sic="Vishnu">Vish&#7751;u</corr>. Naradji went to <corr sic="Vishnu">Vish&#7751;u</corr> and said that in consequence of the curse of Durvasarashi Lakshm&#237; could not be born anywhere except in Braghu&#8217;s house and that <corr sic="Vishnu">Vish&#7751;u</corr> ought to marry her. <corr sic="Vishnu">Vish&#7751;u</corr> agreed. After the <pb id="pb462" n="462"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix III.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Bhinm&#225;l.</hi></item><item>Legends.</item></list> </fw>marriage the bride and bridegroom bathed together in the holy Trimbak pond about half a mile east of Gautam&#8217;s island. The holy water cleared the veil of forgetfulness and Lakshm&#237; remembered her former life. The <hi>devtas</hi> or guardians came to worship her. They asked her what she would wish. Lakshm&#237; replied; May the country be decked with the houses of Br&#225;hmans as the sky is decked with their carriers the stars. Bhagw&#225;n that is <corr sic="Vishnu">Vish&#7751;u</corr>, pleased with this wish, sent messengers to fetch Br&#225;hmans and called Vishvakarma the divine architect to build a town. Vishvakarma built the town. He received golden bangles and a garland of gold lotus flowers and the promise that his work would meet with the praise of men and that his descendants would rule the art of building. This town said the Gods has been decked as it were with the garlands or <hi>m&#225;la</hi> of &#346;r&#237; or Lakshm&#237;. So it shall be called Shrim&#225;la. When the houses were ready Br&#225;hmans began to gather from all parts.<note id="n462.1" n="1">The details are: From Kausika 500, from the Ganges 10,000, from Gaya 500, from K&#225;linjar 700, from Mahendra 300, from Kundad 1000, from Veni 500, from Surp&#225;rak 808, from Gokarn 1000, from God&#225;vari 108, from Prabh&#225;s 122, from the hill Ujjayan or Girn&#225;r 115, from the Narbada 110, from Gometi 79, and from Nandivardhan 1000.</note> When the Br&#225;hmans were gathered Lakshm&#237; asked <corr sic="Vishnu">Vish&#7751;u</corr> to which among the Br&#225;hmans worship was first due. The Br&#225;hmans agreed that Gautam&#8217;s claim was the highest. The Br&#225;hmans from Sindh objected and withdrew in anger. Then <corr sic="Vishnu">Vish&#7751;u</corr> and Lakshm&#237; made presents of clothes<corr>,</corr> money and jewels to the Br&#225;hmans, and they, because they had settled in the town of Shrim&#225;l, came to be known as Shrim&#225;li Br&#225;hmans.

 </p><p>The angry Sindh Br&#225;hmans in their own country worshipped the Sea. And at their request Samudra sent the demon Sarika to ruin Shrim&#225;l. Sarika carried off the marriageable Br&#225;hman girls. And the Br&#225;hmans finding no one to protect them withdrew to &#193;bu. Shrim&#225;l became waste and the dwellings ruins.<note id="n462.2" n="2">According to one account (M&#225;rw&#225;r Castes, 61) these Sindh Br&#225;hmans are represented by the present Pushkar Br&#225;hmans. In proof the Pushkars are said to worship Sarika as Untadevi riding on a camel. This must be a mistake. The Pushkars are almost certainly Gujars.</note> When Shrim&#225;l had long lain waste a king named Shripunj, according to one account suffering from worms<corr>,</corr> according to another account stricken with leprosy, came to the Brahmakund to the south of the city and was cleansed.<note id="n462.3" n="3">Details are given above under Objects. The local legends confuse Shripunj and Jagsom. It seems probable that Jagsom was not the name of a king but is a contraction of Jagatsv&#225;mi the title of the Sun. This Shripunj, or at least the restorer or founder of Shrim&#225;l, is also called Kanak, who according to some accounts came from the east and according to others came from Kashm&#237;r. Kanak is said also to have founded a town Kank&#225;vati near the site of the present village of Chhakla about eleven miles (7 <hi>kos</hi>) east of Bhinm&#225;l. This recollection of Kanak or Kanaksen is perhaps a trace of the possession of M&#225;rw&#225;r and north Gujar&#225;t by the generals or successors of the great Kush&#225;n or &#346;aka emperor Kanak or Kanishka the founder of the &#346;aka era of <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;78. According to the local <corr sic="Bhats">Bh&#225;ts</corr> this Kanak was of the Janghrabal caste and the Pradiya branch. This caste is said still to hold 300 villages in Kashm&#237;r. According to local accounts the Shrim&#225;li Br&#225;hmans, and the Dewala and Devra <corr sic="Rajputs">R&#225;jputs</corr> all came from Kashmir with Kanak. Tod (Western India, 213) notices that the Annals of Mewar all trace to Kanaksen of the Sun race whose invasion is put at <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;100. As the <corr sic="Shrimalis">Shrim&#225;lis</corr> and most of the present <corr sic="Rajput">R&#225;jput</corr> chiefs are of the Gujar stock which entered India about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;450 this tracing to Kanishka is a case of the Hindu law that the conqueror assimilates the traditions of the conquered that with the tradition he may bind to his own family the &#346;r&#237; or Luck of his predecessors.</note> Thankful at heart Shripunj collected Br&#225;hmans and restored Shrim&#225;la and at the Brahmakund built a temple of Chandish Mah&#225;dev. When they heard that the Shrim&#225;l Br&#225;hmans had returned to their old city and were prospering the <pb id="pb463" n="463"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix III.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Bhinm&#225;l.</hi></item><item>Legends.</item></list> </fw>Br&#225;hmans of Sindh once more sent Sarika to carry away their marriageable daughters. One girl as she was being haled away called on her house goddess and Sarika was spell-bound to the spot. King Shripunj came up and was about to slay Sarika with an arrow when Sarika said Do not kill me. Make some provision for my food and I will henceforth guard your Br&#225;hmans. The king asked her what she required. Sarika said Let your Br&#225;hmans at their weddings give a dinner in my honour and let them also marry their daughters in unwashed clothes. If they follow these two rules I will protect them. The king agreed and gave Sarika leave to go. Sarika could not move. While the king wondered the home-goddess of the maiden appeared and told the king she had stopped the fiend. Truly said the king you are the rightful guardian. But Sarika is not ill disposed let her go. On this Sarika fled to Sindh. And in her honour the people both of Shrim&#225;l and of Jodhpur still marry their daughters in unwashed clothes.<note id="n463.1" n="1">According to a local tradition the people in despair at the ravages of Sarika turned for help to Devi. The goddess said: Kill buffaloes, eat their flesh, and wear their hides and Sarika will not touch you. The people obeyed and were saved. Since then a dough buffalo has taken the place of the flesh buffalo and unwashed cloth of the bleeding hide. Another version sounds like a reminiscence of the Tartar origin of K&#7771;ish&#7751;a. The goddess Khamangiri persuaded the Lord K&#7771;ish&#7751;a to celebrate his marriage clad in the raw hide of a cow. In the present era unwashed cloth has taken the place of leather. <abbr>MS.</abbr> Note from Mr. Ratan Lall Pandit.</note> The Br&#225;hman girls whom Sarika had carried off had been placed in charge of the snake Kankal lord of the under world. The Br&#225;hmans found this out and Kankal agreed to restore the girls if the Br&#225;hmans would worship snakes or <hi>n&#225;gs</hi> at the beginning of their <hi>shr&#225;dh</hi> or after-death ceremonies. Since that time the Shrim&#225;lis set up the image of a N&#225;g when they perform death rites.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Caste Legends.</note>That Shrim&#225;l was once the capital of the Gurjjaras seems to explain the local saying that Jagatsen the son of the builder of the Sun temple gave Shrim&#225;l to <corr sic="Gujarat">Gujar&#225;t</corr> Br&#225;hmans where Gujar&#225;t is a natural alteration of the forgotten Gurjjaras or Gurjjara Br&#225;hmans. That Shrim&#225;l was once a centre of population is shown by the Shrim&#225;li subdivisions of the Br&#225;hman and V&#225;ni castes who are widely scattered over north Gujar&#225;t and K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a. Most Shrim&#225;li V&#225;nis are Shr&#225;vaks. It seems probable that their history closely resembles the history of the Osv&#225;l Shr&#225;vaks or Jains who take their name from the ancient city of Osia about fifteen miles south of Jodhpur to which they still go to pay vows. The bulk of these Osv&#225;l V&#225;nis, who are Jains by religion, were Solan&#775;ki <corr sic="Rajputs">R&#225;jputs</corr> before their change of faith which according to Jain records took place about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;743 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 800).<note id="n463.3" n="3">Epigraphia Indica, II. 40&#8211;41.</note> The present Bhinm&#225;l <pb id="pb464" n="464"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix III.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Bhinm&#225;l.</hi></item><item>Caste Legends.</item></list> </fw>bards claim the Osv&#225;ls as originally people of Shrim&#225;l.

 </p><p>The memory of the Gurjjaras, who they say are descended from Garab Rishi, lingers among the Bh&#225;ts or bards of Shrim&#225;l. They say the Gurjjaras moved from Shrim&#225;l to Pushkar about ten miles north-west of Ajm&#237;r and there dug the great lake. They are aware that Gurjjaras have a very sacred burning ground at Pushkar or Pokarn and also that the <corr sic="Savitri">S&#225;vitr&#237;</corr> or wife of Brahma at Pokarn was a Gurjjara maiden.

 </p><p>But as the leading Gurjjar&#225;s have dropped their tribe name in becoming Kshatriy&#225;s or <corr sic="Rajputs">R&#225;jputs</corr> the bards naturally do not know of the Gurjjaras as a ruling race. The ordinary Gurjjara they say is the same as the Rehb&#225;ri; the Bad or High Gujjars to whom K&#7771;ish&#7751;a belonged are <corr sic="Rajputs">R&#225;jputs</corr>. The bards further say that the Sompuras who live near Poshkar (Pokarn north of Ajm&#237;r) and are the best builders who alone know the names of all ornamental patterns are of Gurjjara descent and of Shrim&#225;l origin. They do not admit that the Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s were Gurjjar&#225;s. In their opinion Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s are the same as Bh&#225;rods and came north into M&#225;rw&#225;r from D&#225;nta in Jh&#225;l&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a in north-east K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a. The Choh&#225;ns they say came from S&#225;mbhar to Ajm&#237;r, from Ajm&#237;r to Delhi, from Delhi to N&#225;gor north of Jodhpur, from N&#225;gor to Jodhpur, from Jodhpur to Bhadgaon thirty miles south of Bhinm&#225;l, and from Bhadgaon to Sirohi. According to a local Jaghird&#225;r of the Devra caste the Choh&#225;ns&#8217; original seat was at Jh&#225;lor forty miles north of Shrim&#225;l. They say that in the eighteenth century the Solan&#775;kis came north from P&#225;tan in north Gujar&#225;t to Hiyu in P&#225;lanpur where they have still a settlement, and that from Hiyu they went to Bhinm&#225;l.

 </p><p>In connection with the Sun temple and the traces of sun worship among the Jains, whose <hi>gurus</hi> or religious guides have a sun face which they say was given them by the R&#225;na of Chitor, the existence in Bhinm&#225;l of so many (thirty-five) houses of Shevaks is interesting. These Shevaks are the religious dependents of the Osw&#225;l Shr&#225;vaks. They are strange highnosed hatchet-faced men with long lank hair and long beards and whiskers. They were originally Magha Br&#225;hmans and still are Vaishnavas worshipping the sun. They know that their story is told in the N&#225;magranth of the Surya Pur&#225;na. The Bhinm&#225;l Shevaks know of sixteen <pb id="pb465" n="465"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix III.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Bhinm&#225;l.</hi></item><item>Caste Legends.</item></list> </fw>branches or <hi>s&#225;kas</hi> but remember the names of ten only: Aboti, Bhinm&#225;la, Devira, Hirgota, Kuwara, Lal&#225;r, Mahtariya, Mundiara, Saparw&#225;la, and Sh&#225;nda. The story of these Magh&#225;s in the Surya and Bhavishya <corr sic="Pur&#225;nas">Pur&#225;&#7751;as</corr>, how they were brought by <corr sic="Garuda">Garu&#7693;a</corr> from the land of the &#346;akas and were fire and sun worshippers, gives these Shevaks a special interest. The Deval&#225;s are believed to have come from Kashm&#237;r with Jog Sv&#225;mi who is said to have been a Yaksh of the R&#225;kshas division of Parih&#225;r <corr sic="Rajputs">R&#225;jputs</corr>. The other division of Parih&#225;rs were <hi>gir&#225;sias</hi> of &#193;bu who in virtue of the fire baptism of the Agnikund became Kshatriy&#225;s. The Deval&#225;s are supposed to get their name because they built Jag Som&#8217;s temple at Bhinm&#225;l. The Devra <corr sic="Rajputs">R&#225;jputs</corr> whose head is the Sirohi chief and who according to the bards are of Choh&#225;n descent, came at the same time and marry with the Deval&#225;s. With this origin from Kanaksen it is natural to associate the Devras and Deval&#225;s with the Devaputras of the Samudragupta (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;370&#8211;395) inscription. Of H&#250;&#7751;a or of Javla, the tribe name of the great H&#250;&#7751;a conquerors <corr sic="Toromana">Toram&#225;&#7751;a</corr> and Mihirakula (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;450&#8211;530), few signs have been traced. The Jaghird&#225;r of Devala knows the name H&#250;&#7751;a. They are a R&#225;kshasa people he says. He mentions Honots or Sonots who may be a trace of H&#250;&#7751;as, and H&#250;&#7751;&#225;ls in K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a and a Hu&#7751;i subdivision among the Kunbis of M&#225;rw&#225;r. J&#225;vla he does not know as a caste name.

 </p><p><note place="margin">History.</note>The historical interest of Shrim&#225;l centres in the fact that it was long the capital of the main branch of the great northern race of Gurjjaras. It is well known that many mentions of the Gurjjaras and their country in inscriptions and historical works refer to the Chaulukya or Solan&#775;ki kingdom of <corr sic="Anahilav&#225;&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a</corr> (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;961&#8211;1242) or to its successor the V&#225;ghel&#225; principality (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1219&#8211;1304). But the name Gurjjara occurs also in many documents older than the tenth century and has been most variously and inconsistently explained. Some take the name to denote the Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s of <corr sic="Anahilav&#225;&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a</corr> (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;746&#8211;942), some the Gurjjaras of Broach (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;580&#8211;808) and some, among them Dr. Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l <corr sic="Indr&#225;ji">Indraji</corr>, even the Valabhis (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;509&#8211;766), but not one of these identifications can be made to apply to all cases. As regards the Valabhis even if they were of Gurjjara origin they are not known to have at any time called themselves Gurjjaras or to have been known by that name to their neighbours. The identification with the Gurjjaras of Broach is at first sight more plausible, as they admitted their Gurjjara origin as late as the middle of the seventh century, but there are strong reasons against the identification of the Broach branch as the leading family of Gurjjaras. Pulake&#347;i II. in his Aihole inscription of <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;634 (<abbr>S.</abbr> 556)<note id="n465.1" n="1">Indian Antiquary, VIII. 237.</note> claims to have subdued by his prowess the L&#225;&#7789;as M&#225;lavas and Gurjjaras, which shows that the land of the Gurjjaras was distinct from L&#225;&#7789;a, the province in which Broach stood. Similarly Hiuen Tsiang (c. 640 <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>) speaks of the kingdom of Broach by the name of the city and not as Gurjjara or the Gurjjara country. In the following century the historians of the Arab raids<note id="n465.2" n="2">Elliot, I. 432.</note> notice Barus (Broach) separately from Jurz or Gurjjara, and the Ch&#225;lukya grant of 490 that is of <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;738&#8211;739 mentions the Gurjjaras after the Ch&#225;vo&#7789;akas (Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s) and the Mauryas (of Chitor) as the last of the kingdoms attacked by the Arab army. Later instances occur of a distinction between L&#225;&#7789;a and Gurjjara, but it seems unnecessary to quote them as the Gurjjara kingdom of Broach probably did not survive the <corr sic="R&#225;shtrak&#250;&#7789;a">R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a</corr> conquest of south Gujar&#225;t (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;750&#8211;760).

 </p><p>The evidence that the name Gurjjara was not confined to the Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s <pb id="pb466" n="466"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix III.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Bhinm&#225;l.</hi></item><item>History.</item></list> </fw>is not less abundant.

It might be supposed that as the power of the Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s increased, they became known as the rulers of the Gurjjara country; and it must be admitted that some of the references to Gurjjaras in the <corr sic="R&#225;shtrak&#250;&#7789;a">R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a</corr> grants are vague enough to apply to the Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s. Still, if it can be shown that others of these references cannot possibly apply to the Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s, and if we assume, as we must, that the name of Gurjjara was used with the slightest consistency, it will follow that the ninth and tenth century references to the Gurjjaras do not apply to the Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225; kingdom of <corr sic="Anahilav&#225;&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a</corr>.

 </p><p>The Van-Dindori and R&#225;dhanpur plates of the great R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a Govinda III.<note id="n466.1" n="1">Indian Antiquary, XI. 156 and VI. 59.</note> state that Govinda&#8217;s father Dhruva (<hi rend="sc">C.</hi> 780&#8211;800 <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>) &#8220;quickly caused Vatsar&#225;ja, intoxicated with the goddess of the sovereignty of Gau&#7693;a that he had acquired with ease, to enter upon the path of misfortune in the centre of Maru&#8221; and took away from him the two umbrellas of Gau&#7693;a. A comparison of this statement with that in the Baroda grant of Karka II.<note id="n466.2" n="2">Indian Antiquary, XII. 156.</note> which is dated <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;812&#8211;813, to the effect that Karka made his arm &#8220;the door-bar of the country of the lord of the Gurjjaras, who had become evilly inflamed by conquering the lord of Gau&#7693;a and the lord of Vanga&#8221; makes it highly probable that Vatsar&#225;ja was king of the Gurjjaras at the end of the eighth century. As no such name occurs in the Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225; lists, it follows that the Gurjjaras referred to in the inscriptions of about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;800 were not Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s.

 </p><p>It is also possible to show that more than a century later the Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s were distinct from the Gurjjaras. The K&#225;narese poet Pampa, writing in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;941,<note id="n466.3" n="3"><abbr>Jour. R. A. S.</abbr> XIV. 19ff.</note> states that the father of his patron Arikesari vanquished Mahip&#225;la king of the Gurjjaras, who may be identified with the Mahip&#225;la who is named as overlord in the grant of <corr sic="Dhara&#7751;ivar&#225;ha">Dhara&#7751;&#237;var&#225;ha</corr> of Wadhw&#225;n,<note id="n466.4" n="4">Indian Antiquary, XII. 190 and XVIII. 91.</note> dated <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;914. As no Mahip&#225;la occurs in the Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225; lists, the Gurjjara kingdom must be sought elsewhere than at <corr sic="Anahilav&#225;&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a</corr>. Since the Gurjjaras of the eighth and ninth century inscriptions cannot be identified either with the Valabhis, the Broach Gurjjaras, or the <corr sic="Anahilav&#225;&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a</corr> Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s, they must represent some other family of rulers. A suitable dynasty seems to be supplied by Hiuen Tsiang&#8217;s kingdom of <corr sic="Ki&#250;-che-lo">Kiu-che-lo</corr> or Gurjjara, the capital of which he calls Pi-lo-mo-lo.<note id="n466.5" n="5">Beal&#8217;s Buddhist Records, II. 270.</note> The French translators took Pi-lo-mo-lo to be B&#225;lmer in <corr sic="Rajput&#225;na">R&#225;jput&#225;na</corr>. But Dr. B&#252;hler following the late Colonel Watson, identifies it, no doubt rightly, with Bhinm&#225;l or Bhilm&#225;l.<note id="n466.6" n="6">Indian Antiquary, VI. 63. That the name Bhilm&#225;l should have come into use while the Gurjjaras were still in the height of their power is strange. The explanation may perhaps be that Bhilm&#225;l may mean the Gurjjara&#8217;s town the name Bhil or bowman being given to the Gurjjaras on account of their skill as archers. So Ch&#225;pa the original name of the Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s is Sanskritised into Chapo&#7789;ka&#7789;as the strong bowmen. So also, perhaps, the Ch&#225;pa or Chaura who gave its name to Ch&#225;panir or Ch&#225;mpaner was according to the local story a Bhil. Several tribes of Mew&#225;r Bhils are well enough made to suggest that in their case Bhil may mean Gurjjara. This is specially the case with the Lauriyah Bhils of Nerwer, the finest of the race, whose name further suggests an origin in the Gurjjara division of Lor.

The country was populous and wealthy, but Buddhists were few and unbelievers many. The Gurjjaras did not long retain their southern conquests. In Hiuen Tsiang&#8217;s time both Kaira (Kie-cha) and Vadnagar (&#193;nandapura) belonged to M&#225;lava, while the Broach chiefs probably submitted to the Ch&#225;lukyas. No further reference to the Bhinm&#225;l kingdom has been traced until after the Arab conquest of Sindh when (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;724&#8211;750) the Khalifa&#8217;s governor Junaid sent his plundering bands into all the neighbouring countries and attacked among other places M&#225;rw&#225;d (M&#225;rw&#225;r), Maliba (M&#225;lwa), Barus (Broach), Uzain (Ujjain), Al Bailam&#225;n (Bhilm&#225;l&#160;?), and Jurz (Gurjjara).<note id="n467.4" n="4">Elliot, I. 440&#8211;41.</note> As noticed above the contemporary Ch&#225;lukya plate of <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;738&#8211;9 also mentions Gurjjara as one of the kingdoms attacked. After these events the Arabs seem to have confined themselves to raiding the coast towns of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a without attacking inland states such as Bhinm&#225;l. Immediately after the Arab raids ceased the Gurjjaras had to meet a new enemy the R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as who after supplanting the Ch&#225;lukyas in the Dakhan turned their attention northwards.

As already stated, a comparison with the Baroda grant of Karka II.<note id="n468.2" n="2">Indian Antiquary, XII. 156.</note> shows that this Vatsar&#225;ja was a Gurjjara king and that he had made extensive conquests in Upper India as far east as Bengal. Now it is notable that the genealogies of two of the most important Agnikula races, the Param&#225;ras and the Chauh&#225;ns, go back to this very time (c. 800 <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>)<note id="n468.3" n="3">See the Udaipur <hi><corr sic="p&#7771;a&#347;asti">pra&#347;asti</corr></hi> in <abbr>Ep.

Taking this fact in connection with the prevalence of the surnames Pav&#225;r and Chav&#225;n among Gujars in such remote provinces as the Panj&#225;b and Kh&#225;ndesh, it seems obvious that these two tribes and therefore also the two other Agnikula races, the Parih&#225;rs and Solan&#775;kis are, if not of Gurjjara origin, at all events members of the great horde of northern invaders whom the Gurjjaras led. The agreement between this theory and the Agnikula legends of &#193;bu need only be pointed out to be admitted. The origin of the modern <corr sic="Rajput">R&#225;jput</corr> races has always been one of the puzzles of Indian history. This suggestion seems to offer at least a partial solution.

 </p><p>The R&#225;dhanpur grant (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;807&#8211;8) further states that when the Gurjjara saw Govinda III. approaching, he fled in fear to some unknown hiding-place. This probably means no more than that Vatsar&#225;ja did not oppose Govinda in his march to the Vindhyas. The next reference is in the Baroda grant of Karka II. of Gujar&#225;t who boasts that his father Indra (c. 810 <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>) alone caused the leader of the Gurjjara lords to flee. Karka adds that he himself, for the purpose of protecting M&#225;lava, &#8220;who had been struck down,&#8221; made his arm the door-bar of the country of Gurjjare&#347;vara, who &#8220;had become evilly inflamed&#8221; by the conquest of Gau&#7693;a and Vanga.<note id="n468.4" n="4">See the Baroda grant of <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;812&#8211;13. Indian Antiquary, XII. 156.</note> It is difficult to avoid supposing that we have here a reference to the Param&#225;ra conquest of M&#225;lwa and that Karka checked the southward march of the victorious army. For some years no further mention has been traced of the Gurjjaras. But in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;851 the Arab merchant Sulaiman states<note id="n468.5" n="5">Elliot, I. 4.</note> that the king of Juzr was one of the kings &#8220;around&#8221; the <corr sic="Balhar&#225;">Balh&#225;ra</corr>, that is the R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a, and that he was very hostile to the Musalm&#225;ns, which is not surprising, considering how his kingdom was exposed to the Arab raids from Sindh. Dhruva III. of Broach, in his Bagumr&#225; grant of <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;867<note id="n468.6" n="6">Indian Antiquary, XII. 179.</note> speaks of &#8220;the host of the powerful Gurjjaras&#8221; as one of the dangerous enemies he had to fear.

His fights with the Gurjjaras are compared to the storms of the rainy season, implying that while the relations of the two empires continued hostile, neither was able to gain any decisive advantage over the other. To this same period belongs Ibn Khurd&#225;dba&#8217;s (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;912) statement<note id="n468.9" n="9">Elliot, I. 13.</note> that the king of Juzr was the fourth <pb id="pb469" n="469"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix III.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Bhinm&#225;l.</hi></item><item>History.</item></list> </fw>in rank of the kings of India and that the T&#225;tariya <hi>dirhams</hi> were used in his country.

At this time Kalinjar belonged to the Kalachuris of Central India and Chitrak&#250;&#7789;a or Chito&#7693; to the Gehlots of Mew&#225;&#7693; and the phrase used by K&#7771;ish&#7751;a implies that the Gurjjara chief had his eye on these two famous fortresses and had perhaps already besieged them unsuccessfully. In either case this notice is evidence of the great and far-reaching power of the Gurjjaras. Masudi (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;915) notices that the king of Juzr was frequently at war with the Balhara (R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;a) and that he had a large army and many horses and camels.

This is a valuable confirmation of R&#225;jput tradition, according to which<note id="n470.1" n="1">R&#226;s M&#226;l&#226;, 44.</note> the Param&#225;ra R&#225;ja of &#193;bu was followed by the prince of &#346;r&#237;m&#225;la, when he aided M&#250;lar&#225;ja against Graharipu (c. 990 <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>) and the Param&#225;ras remained paramount in this region until the beginning of the thirteenth century.<note id="n470.2" n="2">R&#226;s M&#226;l&#226;, 210ff.</note> The title of Mah&#225;r&#225;j&#225;dhir&#225;ja meant much less at this period than it meant before the Valabhi kings had cheapened it. Still it shows that K&#7771;ish&#7751;ar&#225;ja&#8217;s rank was considerably higher than that of a mere feudatory chieftain. Inscription No. 3 gives the names of K&#7771;ish&#7751;ar&#225;ja&#8217;s father Dham&#775;dhuka and of his grandfather Devar&#225;ja. The first of these two names occurs in the main line of &#193;bu as the successor of Dh&#250;mar&#225;ja the first Param&#225;ra sovereign.<note id="n470.3" n="3">R&#226;s M&#226;l&#226;, 211.</note> According to <corr sic="Rajput">R&#225;jput</corr> tradition the Param&#225;ras were at one time supreme in Mar&#225;sthal&#237; and held all the nine castles of the Waste. But in the historical period their chief possessions in M&#225;rw&#225;d lay about &#193;bu and Chandr&#225;vati, though we have a glimpse of another branch maintaining itself at Ker&#225;lu near B&#225;dmer.<note id="n470.4" n="4">&#346;r&#237; Bh&#225;unagar Pr&#225;. I. No. 30 of the list of Sanskrit Inscriptions dated Sam&#775;. 1218.</note> The Param&#225;ra chiefs of &#193;bu are constantly referred to in the Solan&#775;ki annals, and during the golden age of the Solan&#775;ki monarchy (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1094&#8211;1174) they were the vassals of that power, and their Bhinm&#225;l branch, if it was ever a distinct chiefship, probably followed the fortunes of the main line, though the Bhinm&#225;l inscriptions give us no facts for this long period. The next item of information is given by Inscription 5, which is dated in the Sam&#775;vat year 1239 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1183) in the reign of the Mah&#225;raul &#346;r&#237; Jayatas&#237;ha-deva. This name is of special interest, as it can hardly be doubted that we have here to do with that &#8220;Jaits&#237; Parm&#225;r&#8221; of &#193;bu whose daughter&#8217;s beauty caused the fatal feud between &#8220;Bh&#237;ma Solan&#775;ki&#8221; of <corr sic="Anahilav&#225;&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a</corr> and Prithir&#225;j Choh&#225;n of Delhi.<note id="n470.5" n="5">&#346;r&#237; R&#226;s M&#226;l&#226;, 161ff.</note> The title of Mah&#226;raul is to be noted as indicating the decline of the family from the great days of K&#7771;ish&#7751;ar&#225;ja.

 </p><p>Towards the end of the thirteenth century the old world was falling to pieces, and the Param&#225;ras lost one after another nearly all their ancient possessions to the Choh&#225;ns of N&#225;&#7693;ol. Bhinm&#225;l must have fallen about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1200 or a few years before, for Inscription No. 6 is dated Sam&#775;vat 1262 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1206) in the reign of the Mah&#225;r&#225;j&#225;dhir&#225;ja &#346;r&#237; Udayasim&#775;had&#234;va, who, as we learn from Inscription 12, was the son of the Mah&#225;raul &#346;r&#237; Samarasim&#775;hadeva, of the Choh&#225;n race. The sudden rise of the son to greatness is implied in the difference of title and it may be inferred that Udayasim&#775;ha himself was the conqueror of Bhinm&#225;l, though the capture of &#193;bu is ascribed by Forbes to a chief named L&#250;niga.<note id="n470.6" n="6">R&#226;s M&#226;l&#226;, 211.</note>

 </p><p>Inscriptions Nos. 6 to 8 being dated in the reign of Udayasim&#775;ha, show that he lived to at least the year <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1249 and therefore reigned at least forty-three years. He is also referred to in the Inscription No. 10, dated <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1274, but in a way that does not necessarily imply that he was still alive, as the record only speaks of an endowment for his spiritual benefit, made by a person who was perhaps an old retainer. His name also occurs in the genealogy in No. 12. His reign was apparently a prosperous one but no historical facts beyond those already noted are known about him.

Udayasim&#775;ha&#8217;s successor, or at all events the next king in whose reign grants are dated, was C&#225;ciga, who is given the title of Mah&#225;raul in Inscriptions 11 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1277) and 12 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1278).<note id="n471.1" n="1">Inscriptions 9 and 10 are not dated in any king&#8217;s reign.</note> His relationship to Udayasim&#775;ha does not clearly appear, but he was probably either an elder brother or an uncle of the C&#225;mu&#7751;&#7693;a for whose benefit the gift recorded in Inscription 12 was made and who seems to be a grandson of Udayasim&#775;ha. C&#225;ciga appears to be the Mah&#225;ma&#7751;&#7693;ale&#347;vara C&#225;ciga of Inscription 15 in the Bh&#225;unagar State Collection (<abbr>Bh&#225;u. Pr&#225;<corr>.</corr></abbr> I. list page 5) which is stated to bear the date Sam&#775;vat 1332 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1276) and to be engraved on a pillar in the temple of P&#225;rsvan&#225;tha at Ratanpur near <corr sic="J&#243;dhpur">Jodhp&#250;r</corr>. It is clear that he was tributary to some greater power though it is not easy to say who his suzerain was. At this period M&#225;rw&#225;r was in a state of chaos under the increasing pressure of the R&#225;tho&#7693;s. Only five years after C&#225;ciga&#8217;s last date (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1278) we meet with the name of a new ruler, the Mah&#225;raul <corr sic="Sr&#237;">&#346;r&#237;</corr> S&#225;mvatasim&#775;ha. He is mentioned in Inscriptions 13 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1283) 14 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1286) and 15 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1289) and also in 44 of the Bh&#225;unagar Collection (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1296 <abbr>Bh&#225;u. Pr&#225;.</abbr> I. list page 13) from a Jain temple at Jun&#225;. He is not stated to have belonged to the same family as the previous rulers, but he bears the family title of Mah&#225;raul, and it may be inferred with probability that he was a son of C&#225;ciga. He reigned for at least thirteen years (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1283&#8211;1296). It must have been about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1300 or a little later, that the <corr sic="Ch&#243;h&#225;ns">Choh&#225;ns</corr> were deprived of Bhinm&#225;l by the R&#225;tho&#7693;s and the line of Udayasim&#775;ha died out.<note id="n471.2" n="2">Compare Tod&#8217;s Rajasth&#225;n, I.</note>

Of the fifteen inscriptions belonging to Jagsv&#225;mi&#8217;s temple nine are in place and six have been removed to other buildings. Of the six which have been moved five are in B&#225;r&#225;ji&#8217;s rest-house in the east and one is in the enclosure of Mah&#225;laksh&#225;m&#237;&#8217;s temple in the south of the town.

This incident is the tradition that during the sixth and seventh centuries fleets from the coasts of Sindh and Gujar&#225;t formed settlements in Java and in Cambodia. The Java legend is that about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;603 Hindus led by Bhruvij&#225;ya Savelach&#225;la the son of Kasamachitra or B&#225;lya Ach&#225; king of Kujr&#225;t or Gujar&#225;t settled on the west coast of the island.<note id="n489.1" n="1">Sir Stamford Raffles&#8217; Java, II. 83. From Java Hindus passed to near Banjar Massin in Borneo probably the most eastern of Hindu settlements (<abbr expan="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">Jour. R. A. Soc.</abbr> IV. 185). Temples of superior workmanship with Hindu figures also occur at Waahoo 400 miles from the coast. Dalton&#8217;s Diaks of Borneo <abbr>Jour.</abbr> Asiatique (<abbr expan="New Series">N. S.</abbr>) VII. 153. An instance may be quoted from the extreme west of Hindu influence. In 1873 an Indian architect was found building a palace at Gondar in Abyssinia. Keith Johnson&#8217;s Africa, 269.</note> The details of the settlement recorded by Sir Stamford Raffles<note id="n489.2" n="2">Raffles&#8217; Java, II. 65&#8211;85. Compare Lassen&#8217;s <foreign lang="de" xml:lang="de">Indische Alterthumskunde</foreign>, II. 10, 40; IV. 460.</note> are that Kasamachitra, ruler of Gujar&#225;t, the tenth in descent from Arjun, was warned of the coming destruction of his kingdom. He accordingly started his son Bhruvij&#225;ya Savelach&#225;la with 5000 followers, among whom were cultivators artisans warriors physicians and writers, in six large and a hundred small vessels for Java. After a voyage of four months the fleet touched at an island they took to be Java. Finding their mistake the pilots put to sea and finally reached Matarem in the island of Java. The prince built the town of Mendang Kumulan. He sent to his father for more men. A reinforcement of 2000 arrived among them carvers in stone and in brass. An extensive commerce sprang up with Gujar&#225;t and other countries. The bay of Matarem was filled with stranger vessels and temples were built both at the capital, afterwards known as Brambanum, and, during the reign of Bhruvij&#225;ya&#8217;s grandson Ardivij&#225;ya that is about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;660, at Boro Buddor in Kedu.<note id="n489.3" n="3">Raffles&#8217; Java, II. 87.</note> The remark that an ancestor of the immigrant prince had changed the name of his kingdom to Gujar&#225;t is held by Lassen to prove that the tradition is modern. Instead of telling against the truth of the tradition this note is a strong argument in its favour. One of the earliest mentions of the name Gujar&#225;t for south M&#225;rw&#225;r is Hiuen Tsiang&#8217;s (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;630) Kiu-che-lo or Gurjjara. As when Hiuen Tsiang wrote the Gurjjara chief of Bhinm&#225;l, fifty miles west of &#193;bu, already ranked as a Kshatriya his family had probably been for some time established perhaps as far back as <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;490 a date by which the Mihira or Gurjjara conquest of Valabhi and north Gujar&#225;t was completed.<note id="n489.4" n="4">Compare Tod&#8217;s Annals of R&#225;jasth&#225;n (Third Reprint), I. 87. The thirty-nine Choh&#225;n successions, working back from about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1200 with an average reign of eighteen years, lead to <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;498.</note> The <pb id="pb490" n="490"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix IV.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Java.</hi></item></list> </fw>details of the help received from Gujar&#225;t after the prince&#8217;s arrival show that the parent state had weathered the storm which threatened to destroy it. This agrees with the position of the Bhinm&#225;l Gurjjaras at the opening of the seventh century, when, in spite of their defeat by Prabh&#225;karavardhana (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;600&#8211;606) the father of &#346;r&#237; Harsha (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;606&#8211;641) of Magadha, they maintained their power at Broach and at Valabhi as well as at Bhinm&#225;l.<note id="n490.1" n="1">Compare Note on Bhinm&#225;l page <ref type="pageref" target="pb467">467</ref>.</note> The close relations between the Gurjjaras and the great seafaring Mihiras or Meds make it likely that the captains and pilots who guided the fleets to Java belonged to the Med tribe. Perhaps it was in their honour that the new Java capital received the name Mendan, as, at a later period it was called Brambanum or the town of Br&#225;hmans. The fact that the Gurjjaras of Broach were sun-worshippers not Buddhists causes no difficulty since the Bhilm&#225;l Gurjjaras whom Hiuen Tsiang visited in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;630 were Buddhists and since at Valabhi Buddhism Shaivism and sun-worship seem to have secured the equal patronage of the state.

 </p><p>Besides of Gujar&#225;t and its king the traditions of both Java and Cambodia contain references to Hastinagara or Hastinapura, to Taxila, and to Rumadesa.<note id="n490.2" n="2">According to Cunningham (Ancient Geography, 43 and Beal&#8217;s Buddhist Records, I. 109 note 92) the site of <hi rend="bold">Hastinagara</hi> or the eight cities is on the Sw&#225;t river eighteen miles north of Pesh&#225;war. In Vedic and early Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata times Hastinapura was the capital of Gandh&#225;ra (Hewitt <abbr expan="Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society">Jour. Roy. As. Soc.</abbr> XXI. 217). In the seventh century it was called Pushkal&#225;vat&#237;. (Beal&#8217;s Buddhist Records, I. 109.) <hi rend="bold">Taxila</hi>, the capital of the country east of the Indus, was situated about forty miles east of Attok at Sh&#225;hderi near K&#225;laka-sarai (Cunningham&#8217;s Ancient Geography, 105). According to Cunningham (Ditto 109), Taxila continued a great city from the time of Alexander till the fifth century after Christ. It was then laid waste apparently by the great White H&#250;&#7751;a conqueror <corr sic="Mihirak&#363;la">Mihirakula</corr> (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;500&#8211;550). A hundred years later when Hiuen Tsiang visited it the country was under Kashmir, the royal family were extinct, and the nobles were struggling for power (Beal&#8217;s Buddhist Records, I. 136). <hi rend="bold">Rumadesa</hi>. References to Rumadesa occur in the traditions of Siam and Cambodia as well as in those of Java. Fleets of R&#250;m are also noted in the traditions of Bengal and Orissa as attacking the coast (Fergusson&#8217;s Architecture, III. 640). Coupling the mention of R&#250;m with the tradition that the Cambodian temples were the work of Alexander the Great Colonel Yule (<abbr>Ency. Brit.</abbr> Article Cambodia) takes R&#250;m in its Musalm&#225;n sense of Greece or Asia Minor. The variety of references suggested to Fergusson (Architecture, III. 640) that these exploits are a vague memory of Roman commerce in the Bay of Bengal. But the Roman rule was that no fleet should pass east of Ceylon (Reinaud <abbr expan=" Journal Asiatique">Jour. As.</abbr> <abbr>Ser.</abbr> VI. <abbr>Tom.</abbr> I. page 322). This rule may occasionally have been departed from as in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;166 when the emperor Marcus Aurelius sent an ambassador by sea to China. Still it seems unlikely that Roman commerce in the Bay of Bengal was ever active enough to gain a place as settler and coloniser in the traditions of Java and Cambodia. It was with the west not with the east of India that the relations of Rome were close and important. From the time of Mark Antony to the time of Justinian, that is from about <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;30 to <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;550, their political importance as allies against the Parthians and Sassanians and their commercial importance as controllers of one of the main trade routes between the east and the west made the friendship of the Kush&#225;ns or &#346;akas who held the Indus valley and Baktria a matter of the highest importance to Rome. How close was the friendship is shown in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;60 by the Roman General Corbulo escorting the Hyrkanian ambassadors up the Indus and through the territories of the Kush&#225;ns or Indo-Skythians on their return from their embassy to Rome. (Compare Rawlinson&#8217;s Parthia, 271.) The close connection is shown by the accurate details of the Indus valley and Baktria recorded by Ptolemy (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;166) and about a hundred years later (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;247) by the author of the Periplus and by the special value of the gifts which the Periplus notices were set apart for the rulers of Sindh. One result of this long continued alliance was the gaining by the Kush&#225;n and other rulers of <corr sic="Peshawar">Pesh&#225;war</corr> and the Panj&#225;b of a knowledge of Roman coinage astronomy and architecture. Certain Afgh&#225;n or Baktrian coins bear the word Roma apparently the name of some Afgh&#225;n city. In spite of this there seems no <pb/>reason to suppose that Rome attempted to overlord the north-west of India still less that any local ruler was permitted to make use of the great name of Rome. It seems possible that certain notices of the fleets of R&#250;m in the Bay of Bengal refer to the fleets of the Arab Al-Rami that is Lambri or north-west Sumatra apparently the Romania of the Chaldean breviary of the Malab&#225;r Coast. (Yule&#8217;s Cathay, I. lxxxix. note and Marco Polo, II. 243.)</note> With regard to these names and also with regard to Gandh&#225;ra <pb id="pb491" n="491"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix IV.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Java.</hi></item></list> </fw>and to Cambodia, all of which places are in the north-west of India, the question arises whether the occurrence of these names implies an historical connection with K&#225;bul Pesh&#225;war and the west Panj&#225;b or whether they are mere local applications and assumptions by foreign settlers and converts of names known in the Br&#225;hman and Buddhist writings of India.<note id="n491.1" n="1">Compare Fergusson&#8217;s Architecture, III. 640; Yule in <abbr>Ency. Brit.</abbr> Cambodia.</note> That elaborate applications of names mentioned in the Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata to places in Java have been made in the Java version of the <corr sic="Mah&#225;bhar&#225;ta">Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata</corr> is shown by Raffles.<note id="n491.2" n="2">Java, I. 411. Compare Fergusson&#8217;s Architecture, III. 640.</note> Still it is to be noticed that the places mentioned above, Kamboja or K&#225;bul, <corr sic="Gandhara">Gandh&#225;ra</corr> or Pesh&#225;war, Taxila or the west Panj&#225;b, and Rumadesa apparently the south Panj&#225;b are not, like Ayodhya the capital of Siam or like <hi>Intha-patha-puri</hi> that is Indraprastha or Dehli the later capital of Cambodia,<note id="n491.3" n="3">See Yule in <abbr>Jour. Roy. As. Soc.</abbr> (<abbr expan="New Series">N. S.</abbr>), I. 356; Fergusson&#8217;s Architecture, III. 631.</note> the names of places which either by their special fame or by their geographical position would naturally be chosen as their original home by settlers or converts in Java and Cambodia. Fair ground can therefore be claimed for the presumption that the leading position given to Kamboja, Gandh&#225;ra, Taxila, and Rumadesa in Javan and Cambodian legends and place-names is a trace of an actual and direct historical connection between the north-west of India and the Malay Archipelago. This presumption gains probability by the argument from the architectural remains of the three countries which in certain peculiar features show so marked a resemblance both in design and in detail as in the judgment of Mr. Fergusson to establish a strong and direct connection.<note id="n491.4" n="4">Of the Java remains Mr. Fergusson writes (Architecture, III. 644&#8211;648): The style and character of the sculptures of the great temple of Boro Buddor are nearly identical with those of the later caves of Ajanta, on the Western Gh&#225;ts, and in S&#225;lsette. The resemblance in style is almost equally close with the buildings of Takht-i-Bahi in <corr sic="Gandh&#225;dra">Gandh&#225;ra</corr> (Ditto, 647). Again (page 637) he says: The Hindu immigrants into Java came from the west coast of India. They came from the valley of the Indus not from the valley of the Ganges. Once more, in describing No. XXVI. of the Ajanta caves Messrs. Fergusson and Burgess (Rock-cut Temples, 345 note 1) write: The execution of these figures is so nearly the same as in the Boro Buddor temple in Java that both must have been the work of the same artists during the latter half of the seventh century or somewhat later. The Buddhists were not in Java in the fifth century. They must have begun to go soon after since there is a considerable local element in the Boro Buddor.</note> A third argument in favour of a Gujar&#225;t strain in Java are the traditions of settlements and expeditions by the rulers of M&#225;lwa which are still current in south M&#225;rw&#225;r.<note id="n491.5" n="5">Traditions of expeditions by sea to Java remain in M&#225;rw&#225;r. In April 1895 a bard at Bhinm&#225;l related how Bhojr&#225;ja of Ujjain in anger with his son Chandrabau drove him away. The son went to a Gujar&#225;t or K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a port obtained ships and sailed to Java. He took with him as his Br&#225;hman the son of a Magh Pandit. A second tale tells how Vikram the redresser of evils in a dream saw a Javanese woman weeping, because by an enemy&#8217;s curse her son had been turned into stone. Vikram sailed to Java found the woman and removed the curse. According to a third legend Chandraw&#225;n the grandson of Vir Pram&#225;r saw a beautiful woman in a dream. He travelled everywhere in search of her. At last a Rishi told him the girl lived in Java. He started by sea and after many dangers and wonders found the dream-girl in Java. The people of Bhinm&#225;l are familiar with the Gujar&#225;ti proverb referred to below<corr>;</corr> Who goes to Java comes not back. <abbr expan="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> Notes, March 1895.</note> Further a proverb <pb id="pb492" n="492"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix IV.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Java.</hi></item></list> </fw>still well known both in M&#225;rw&#225;r and in Gujar&#225;t runs:

This Sir S. Raffles supposed to be the Red Sea but the Mihiras&#8217; or Meds&#8217; sea may be suggested as it seems to correspond to the somewhat doubtful Arab name Baharimad (sea of the Meds&#160;?) for a town in western India sacked by Junaid. Against this evidence two considerations have been urged<note id="n492.2" n="2">Compare Crawford (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1820) in <abbr>As. Res.</abbr> XIII. 157 and Lassen Ind. Alt. II. 1046.</note>: (<hi>a</hi>) The great length of the voyage from Gujar&#225;t to Java compared with the passage to Java from the east coast of India; (<hi>b</hi>) That no people in India have known enough of navigation to send a fleet fit to make a conquest. As regards the length of the voyage it is to be remembered that though Sumatra is more favourably placed for being colonised from Bengal Orissa and the mouths of the God&#225;vari and <corr sic="Krishna">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</corr>, in the case either of Java or of Cambodia the distance from the Sindh and K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a ports is not much greater and the navigation is in some respects both safer and simpler than from the coasts of Orissa and Bengal. In reply to the second objection that no class of Hindus have shown sufficient skill and enterprise at sea to justify the belief that they could transport armies of settlers from Gujar&#225;t to Java, the answer is that the assumption is erroneous. Though the bulk of Hindus have at all times been averse from a seafaring life yet there are notable exceptions. During the last two thousand years the record of the Gujar&#225;t coast shows a genius for seafaring fit to ensure the successful planting of north-west India in the Malay Archipelago.<note id="n492.3" n="3">The following details summarise the available evidence of Gujar&#225;t Hindu enterprise by sea. According to the Greek writers, though it is difficult to accept their statements as free from exaggeration, when, in <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;325, Alexander passed down the Indus the river showed no trace of any trade by sea. If at that time sea trade at the mouth of the Indus was so scanty as to escape notice it seems fair to suppose that Alexander&#8217;s ship-building and fleet gave a start to deep-sea sailing which the constant succession of strong and vigorous northern tribes which entered and ruled Western India during the centuries before and after the Christian era continued to <sic>develope</sic>.<note id="n492.3.a" n="A">Alexander built his own boats on the Indus. (McCrindle&#8217;s Alexander, 77.) He carried (pages 93 and 131) these boats to the Hydaspes: on the Jhelum (134 note 1) where he found some country boats he built a flotilla of gallies with thirty oars: he made dockyards (pages 156&#8211;157): his crews were <sic>Phoenikians</sic>, Cyprians, Karians, and Egyptians.</note> According to Vincent (Periplus, I. 25, 35, 254) in the time of Agatharcides (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;200) the ports of Arabia and Ceylon were entirely in the hands of the people of Gujar&#225;t. During the second century after Christ, when, under the great Rudrad&#225;man (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;143&#8211;158), the Sinh or Kshatrapa dynasty of K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a was at the height of its power, Indians of Tient&#231;o, that is Sindhu, brought presents by sea to China (Journal Royal Asiatic Society for January 1896 page 9). In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;166 (perhaps the same as the preceding) the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius sent by sea to China ambassadors with ivory rhinoceros&#8217; horn and other articles apparently the produce of Western India (DeGuignes&#8217; Huns, I. [Part I.] 32). In the third century <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;247 the Periplus (McCrindle, 17, 52, 64, 96, 109) <pb/>notices large Hindu ships in the east African Arab and Persian ports and Hindu settlements on the north coast of Sokotra. About a century later occurs the doubtful reference (Wilford in Asiatic Researches, IX. 224) to the Diveni or pirates of Diu who had to send hostages to Constantine the Great (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;320&#8211;340) one of whom was Theophilus afterwards a Christian bishop. Though it seems probable that the Kshatrapas (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;70&#8211;400) ruled by sea as well as by land fresh seafaring energy seems to have marked the arrival on the Sindh and K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693; coasts of the Juan-Juan or Avars (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;390&#8211;450) and of the White H&#250;&#7751;as (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;450&#8211;550). During the fifth and sixth centuries the ports of Sindh and Gujar&#225;t appear among the chief centres of naval enterprise in the east. How the sea ruled the religion of the newcomers is shown by the fame which gathered round the new or revised gods &#346;iva the Poseidon of Somn&#225;th and <corr sic="Krishna">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</corr> the Apollo or St. Nicholas of Dw&#225;rka. (Compare Tod&#8217;s Annals of R&#225;jasth&#225;n, I. 525.) In the fifth century (Yule&#8217;s Cathay, I. lxxviii.) according to Hamza of Ispah&#225;n, at Hira near Kufa on the Euphrates the ships of India and China were constantly moored. In the early sixth century (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;518&#8211;519) a Persian ambassador went by sea to China (Ditto, I. lxxiv.) About the same time (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;526) Cosmas (Ditto, I. clxxviii.) describes Sindhu or Debal and Orhota that is Soratha or Ver&#225;val as leading places of trade with Ceylon. In the sixth century, apparently driven out by the White H&#250;&#7751;as and the Mihiras, the Jats from the Indus and Kachh occupied the islands in the Bahrein gulf, and perhaps manned the fleet with which about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;570 Naushirav&#225;n the great Sassanian (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;531&#8211;574) is said to have invaded the lower Indus and perhaps Ceylon.<note id="n492.3.a2" n="A">Reinaud&#8217;s <foreign lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M&#233;moire Sur L&#8217;Inde</foreign>, 125. The statement that Naushirav&#225;n received Kar&#225;chi from the king of Seringdip (Elliot&#8217;s History, I. 407: Tabari, II. 221) throws doubt on this expedition to Ceylon. At the close of the sixth century Kar&#225;chi or Diul Sindhi cannot have been in the gift of the king of Ceylon. It was in the possession of the S&#225;har&#225;i kings of Aror in Upper Sindh perhaps of Sh&#225;hi Tegin Devaja shortened to Shahindev. (Compare Cunningham Oriental Congress, I. 242.) According to Garrez (<abbr>J. As.</abbr> <abbr>Ser.</abbr> VI. <abbr>Tom.</abbr> XIII. 182 note 2) this Serendip is Surandeb that is Syria and Antioch places which Naushirav&#225;n is known to have taken. Several other references that seem to imply a close connection between Gujar&#225;t and Ceylon are equally doubtful. In the Mah&#225;bh&#225;rata (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;100&#8211;300?) the Sinhalas bring <hi>vaid&#250;ryas</hi> (rubies?) elephants&#8217; housings and heaps of pearls.

In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1005 when Abul Fatha the Carmatian ruler of Mult&#225;n was attacked by M&#225;hmud of Ghazni he retired to Ceylon. (Reinaud&#8217;s <foreign lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M&#233;moire</foreign>, 225). When Somn&#225;th was taken (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1025) the people embarked for Ceylon (Ditto, 270).</note> About the same time (Fergusson Architecture, III. 612) Amr&#225;vati at the <corr sic="Krishna">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</corr> mouth was superseded as the port for the Golden Chersonese by the direct voyage from Gujar&#225;t and the west coast of India. In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;630 Hiuen Tsiang (Beal&#8217;s Buddhist Records, II. 269) describes the people of <corr sic="Sur&#225;shtra">Sur&#225;sh&#7789;ra</corr> as deriving their livelihood from the sea, engaging in commerce, and exchanging commodities. He further notices that in the chief cities of Persia Hindus were settled enjoying the full practice of their religion (Reinaud&#8217;s Abulfeda, ccclxxxv.) That the Jat not the Arab was the moving spirit in the early (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;637&#8211;770) Muhammadan sea raids against the Gujar&#225;t and Konkan coasts is made probable by the fact that these seafaring ventures began not in Arabia but in the Jat-settled shores of the Persian Gulf, that for more than fifty years the Arab heads of the state forbad them, and that in the Mediterranean where they had no Jat element the Arab was powerless at sea. (Compare Elliot, I. 416, 417.) That during the seventh and eighth centuries when the chief migrations by sea from Gujar&#225;t to Java and Cambodia seem to have taken place, Chinese fleets visited Diu (Yule&#8217;s Cathay, lxxix.), and that in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;759 Arabs and Persians besieged Canton and pillaged the storehouses going and returning by sea (DeGuignes&#8217; Huns, I. [Pt.

Reinaud&#8217;s Abulfeda, cdxxv.</note> On the Sindh Kachh and Gujar&#225;t coasts besides the Jats several of the new-come northern tribes showed notable energy at sea. It is to be remembered that as detailed in the Statistical Account of Th&#225;na (Bombay Gazetteer, XIII. Part II. 433) this remarkable outburst of sea enterprise may have been due not only to the vigour of the new-come northerners but to the fact that some of them, perhaps the famous iron-working Turks (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;580&#8211;680), brought with them the knowledge of the magnet, and that the local Br&#225;hman, with religious skill and secrecy, shaped the bar into a divine fish-machine or <hi>machiyantra</hi>, which, floating in a basin of oil, he consulted in some private quarter of the ship and when the stars were hid guided the pilot in what direction to steer. Among new seafaring classes were, on the Makr&#225;n and Sindh <pb/>coasts the Bodhas Kerks and Meds and along the shores of Kachh and K&#225;thi&#225;v&#225;&#7693;a the closely connected Meds and Gurjjaras. In the seventh and eighth centuries the Gurjjaras, chiefly of the Ch&#225;pa or Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225; clan, both in Dw&#225;rka and Somn&#225;th and also inland, rose to power, a change which, as already noticed, may explain the efforts of the Jats to settle along the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. About <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;740 the <corr sic="Ch&#225;p&#225;s">Ch&#225;pas</corr> or Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s, who had for a century and a half been in command in Dw&#225;rka and Somn&#225;th, established themselves at <corr sic="Anahilav&#225;&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a</corr> Pattan.

Yogar&#225;ja&#8217;s sons plundered some Bengal or Bot ships which stress of weather forced into Ver&#225;val. The king said &#8216;My sons with labour we were raising ourselves to be Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225;s of princely rank; your greed throws us back on our old nickname of Choras or thieves.&#8217; Yogar&#225;ja refused to be comforted and mounted the funeral pyre. Dr. <corr sic="Bhagvanl&#225;l&#8217;s">Bhagv&#225;nl&#225;l&#8217;s</corr> History, 154. This tale seems to be a parable. Yogar&#225;ja&#8217;s efforts to put down piracy seem to have driven large bodies of Jats from the Gujar&#225;t coasts. In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;834&#8211;35, according to Ibn Alathyr (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;834), a fleet manned by Djaths or Jats made a descent on the Tigris. The whole strength of the Khil&#225;fat had to be set in motion to stop them. Those who fell into the hands of the Moslems were sent to Anararbe on the borders of the Greek empire (Renaud&#8217;s Fragments, 201&#8211;2). As in the legend, the Ch&#225;va&#7693;&#225; king&#8217;s sons, that is the Chauras Mers and Gurjjaras, proved not less dangerous pirates than the Jats whom they had driven out.<note id="n492.3.a3" n="A">As an example of the readiness with which an inland race of northerners conquer seamanship compare the Franks of the Pontus who about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;279 passed in a few years from the Pontus to the Mediterranean ports and leaving behind them Malta the limit of Greek voyages sailed through Gibraltar to the Baltic. Gibbon, I. 404&#8211;405.</note> About fifty years later, in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;892, Al-Bil&#225;duri describes as pirates who scoured the seas the Meds and the people of <corr sic="Saur&#225;shtra">Saur&#225;sh&#7789;ra</corr> that is Devpatan or Somn&#225;th who were Choras or Gurjjaras.<note id="n492.3.b2" n="B">Reinaud&#8217;s <foreign lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M&#233;moire Sur L&#8217;Inde</foreign>, 200. The traders of Chorw&#225;r, that is of the old Chaura or Ch&#225;pa country near Vir&#225;val and Mangrul, are now known in Bombay as Ch&#225;padias. The received explanation of Ch&#225;padia is the roofed men it is said in derisive allusion to their large and heavy headdress. But as the Porbandar headdress is neither specially large nor ungraceful the common explanation can be hardly more than a pun. This suggests that the name Ch&#225;padia is a trace of the early Ch&#225;pa tribe of Gurjjaras who also gave their name to Ch&#225;panir. Tod&#8217;s (Western India, 250, 256) description of the Chauras race with traditions of having come from the Red Sea and as a nautical Arabia is the result of taking for Sokotra Sankodw&#225;ra that is Bet to the north of Dw&#225;rka.</note> Bil&#225;duri (Reinaud <foreign lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sur L&#8217;Inde</foreign>, 169) further notices that the Jats and other Indians had formed the same type of settlement in Persia which the Persians and Arabs had formed in India. During the ninth and tenth centuries the Gujar&#225;t kingdom which had been established in Java was at the height of its power. (Ditto, Abulfeda, ccclxxxviii.) Early in the tenth century (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;915&#8211;930) Masudi (Yule&#8217;s Marco Polo, II. 344; Elliot, I. 65) describes Sokotra as a noted haunt of the Indian corsairs called Baw&#225;rij which chase Arab ships bound for India and China. The merchant fleets of the early tenth century were not Arab alone. The Chauras of <corr sic="Anahilav&#225;&#7693;a">A&#7751;ahilav&#225;&#7693;a</corr> sent fleets to Bhot and Chin (R&#225;s M&#225;la, I. 11). Nor were Mers and Chauras the only pirates.

In the eleventh century (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1021) Alberuni (Sachau, II. 104) notes that the Baw&#225;rij, who take their name from their boats called <hi>behra</hi> or <hi>bira</hi>, were Meds a seafaring people of Kachh and of Somn&#225;th a great place of call for merchants trading between Sofala in east Africa and China. About the same time (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1025) when they despaired of withstanding M&#225;hmud of Ghazni the defenders of Somn&#225;th prepared to escape by sea,<note id="n492.3.c" n="C">According to Abulfeda <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1334 (Reinaud&#8217;s Abulfeda, cccxlix.) some of the besieged fled to Ceylon. Farishtah (Briggs&#8217; Muhammadan Powers, I. 75) records that after the fall of Somn&#225;th M&#225;hmud intended to fit out a fleet to conquer Ceylon and Pegu. According to Bird (Mir&#225;t-i-Ahmedi, 146) Ceylon or Sirandip remained a dependency of Somn&#225;th till <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1290 when the king Vijayab&#225;hu became independent.</note> and after his victory M&#225;hmud is said to have planned an expedition by sea to conquer Ceylon (Tod&#8217;s Rajasth&#225;n, I. 108).

In <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1290 Marco Polo (Yule&#8217;s Ed. II. 325, 328, 341) found the people of Gujar&#225;t the most desperate <pb/>pirates in existence. More than a hundred corsair vessels went forth every year taking their wives and children with them and staying out the whole summer. They joined in fleets of twenty to thirty and made a sea cordon five or six miles apart. Sokotra was infested by multitudes of Hindu pirates who encamped there and put up their plunder to sale. Ibn Batuta (in Elliot, I. 344&#8211;345) fifty years later makes the same complaint. Musalm&#225;n ascendancy had driven R&#225;jput chiefs to the coast and turned them into pirates. The most notable addition was the Gohils who under Mokher&#225;ji Gohil, from his castle on Piram island, ruled the sea till his power was broken by Muhammad Tughlak in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1345 (R&#225;s M&#225;la, I. 318).

Reasons have been given for holding that neither the commercial nor the political ascendancy of Rome makes it probable that to Rome the R&#250;m of the legends refers. The notable Roman element in the architecture of Java and Cambodia may suggest that the memory of great Roman builders kept for Rome a place in the local legends. But the Roman element seems not to have come direct into the buildings of Java or Cambodia; as at Amr&#225;vati at the <corr sic="Krishna">K&#7771;ish&#7751;a</corr> mouth, the classic characteristics came by way of the Panj&#225;b (T&#225;hia) only, in the case of Java, not by the personal taste and study of a prince, but as an incident of conquest and settlement.<note id="n496.1" n="1">Compare Hiuen Tsiang in Beal&#8217;s Buddhist Records, II. 222 note 102. <hi>T&#225;hia</hi> may be Tochara that is Baktria, but the Panj&#225;b seems more likely.

 </p><p>The success of the Javan enterprise would tempt others to follow especially as during the latter half of the sixth and almost the whole of the seventh centuries, the state of North India favoured migration. Their defeats by Sassanians and Turks between <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;550 and 600 would close to the White H&#250;&#7751;as the way of retreat northwards by either the Indus or the K&#225;bul valleys.

Sir H. Yule held that the connection was purely literary and that as in the case of Inthapatha-puri or Indraprastha (Dehli) the later capital of Cambodia and of Ayodhya or Oudh the capital of Assam no connection existed beyond the application to a new settlement of ancient worshipful Indian place-names. The objection to applying this rule to Cambodia is that except to immigrants from the K&#225;bul valley the name is of too distant and also of too scanty a reputation to be chosen in preference to places in the nearer and holier lands of Tirhut and Magadha. For this reason, and because the view is supported by the notable connection between the two styles of architecture, it seems advisable to accept Mr. Fergusson&#8217;s decision that the name Cambodia was given to a portion of Cochin-China by immigrants from Kamboja that is from the K&#225;bul valley. Traces remain of more than one migration from India to Indo-China. The earliest is the mythic account of the conversion of Indo-China to Buddhism before the time of A&#347;oka (<hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>&#160;240). A migration in the first century <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi> of Yavanas or &#346;akas, from Tamluk or Ratn&#225;vate on the Hugli, is in agreement with the large number of Indian place-names recorded by Ptolemy (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;160).<note id="n499.1" n="1">See Hunter&#8217;s Orissa, I. 310.</note> Of this migration Hiuen Tsiang&#8217;s name Yavana (Yen-mo-na) for Cambodia may be a trace.<note id="n499.2" n="2">Yavana to the south-west of Siam.

Three local Cambodian considerations go some way to fill this gap. The first is that unlike the Siamese and Cochin Chinese the Khmers are a strong well made race with very little trace of the Mongoloid, with a language devoid of the intonations of other Indo-Chinese dialects, and with the hair worn cropped except the top-knot. The second point is that the Khmers claim a northern origin; and the third that important architectural remains similar to Nakhonwat are found within Siam limits about sixty miles north of Angkor.<note id="n502.2" n="2">Yule in <abbr>Ency.

Hiuen Tsiang&#8217;s details of the Tarim Oxus and Sw&#225;t valleys contain nothing so remarkable as the apparent increase of Dragon worship. In those countries dragons are rarely mentioned by Fa Hian in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;400: dragons seem to have had somewhat more importance in the eyes of Sung-Yun in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;520; and to Hiuen Tsiang, the champion of the Mah&#225;y&#225;na or Broadway, dragons are everywhere explaining all misfortunes earthquakes storms and diseases. Buddhism may be the state religion but the secret of luck lies in pleasing the Dragon.<note id="n502.3" n="3"><p>Fa Hian (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;400) about fifty miles north-west of Kanauj found a dragon chapel (Beal&#8217;s Buddhist Records, I. 40) of which a white-eared dragon was the patron. The dragon, he notes, gives seasonable showers and keeps off all plagues and calamities. At the end of the rains the dragon turns into a little white-eared serpent and the priests feed him. At the deserted Kapilavastu in Tirhut Fa Hian was shown a tank and in it a dragon who, he says, constantly guards and protects a tower to Buddha and worships there night and morning (Ditto, I. 50).

 </p><p>Sung-Yun (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;519) notices (Beal&#8217;s Buddhist Records, I. 69) in Sw&#225;t (Udy&#225;na) a tank and a temple with fifty priests called the temple of the N&#225;ga R&#225;ja because the N&#225;ga supplies it with funds. In another passage (Ditto, 92) he notices that in a narrow land on the border of Posse (Fars) a dragon had taken his residence and was stopping the rain and piling the snow. Hiuen Tsiang (Ditto, I. 20) notes that in Kucha, north of the Tarim river east of the Bolor mountains, the Shen horses are half dragon horses and the Shen men half dragon men. In Aksu, 150 miles west of Kucha, fierce dragons molest travellers with storms of flying sand and gravel (Ditto, 25); the hot lake or Johai, 100 miles north-east of Aksu, is jointly inhabited by dragons and fish; scaly monsters rise to the surface and travellers pray to them (Ditto, 26). An Arhat (page 63) prays that he may become a N&#225;gar&#225;ja. He becomes a N&#225;gar&#225;ja, kills the real N&#225;gar&#225;ja, takes his palace, attaches the N&#225;gas to him, and raises winds and tempests; Kanishka comes against him and the Arhat takes the form of a Br&#225;hman and knocks down Kanishka&#8217;s towers. A great merit-flame bursts from Kanishka&#8217;s shoulders and the Br&#225;hman N&#225;gar&#225;ja apologises. His evil and passionate spirit, the fruit of evil deeds in a former birth, had made the Arhat pray to be a N&#225;gar&#225;ja. If clouds gathered the monks knew that the N&#225;gar&#225;ja meant mischief. The convent gong was beaten and the N&#225;gar&#225;ja pacified (or scared) Ditto, 64&#8211;66. N&#225;gas were powerful brutes, cloud-riding wind-driving water-walking brutes, still only brutes. The account of the N&#225;ga or dragon of Jelal&#225;b&#225;d (in Kambojia) is excellent. In Buddha&#8217;s time the dragon had been Buddha&#8217;s milkman. He lost his temper, laid flowers at the Dragon&#8217;s cave, prayed he might become a dragon, and leaped over the cliff. He laid the country waste and did so much harm that Tath&#225;gata (or Buddha) converted him. The N&#225;ga asked Buddha to take his cave. Buddha said No. I will leave my shadow. If you get angry look at my shadow and it will quiet you (Ditto, <pb/>94). Another typical dragon is Apal&#225;la of the Sw&#225;t river (Ditto, 68). In the time of Ka&#347;yapa Buddha Apal&#225;la was a weaver of spells named Gangi. Gangi&#8217;s spells kept the dragons quiet and saved the crops. But the people were thankless and paid no tithes. May I be born a dragon, cursed Gangi, poisonous and ruinous. He was born the dragon of the Sw&#225;t valley, Apal&#225;la, who belched forth a salt stream and burned the crops. The ruin of the fair and pious valley of Sw&#225;t reached &#346;akya&#8217;s (Buddha&#8217;s) ears. He passed to Mangala and beat the mountain side with Indra&#8217;s mace. Apal&#225;la came forth was lectured and converted. He agreed to do no more mischief on condition that once in twelve years he might ruin the crops. (Ditto, 122.) In a lake about seven miles west of Taksha&#347;il&#225;, a spot dear to the exiled Kambojan, lived El&#225;patra the N&#225;gar&#225;ja, a Bhikshu or ascetic who in a former life had destroyed a tree. When the crops wanted rain or fair weather, the Shamans or medicine-men led the people to pray at El&#225;patra&#8217;s tank (page 137). In Kashmir, perhaps the place of halt of the Kambojan in his conquests eastwards, in old times the country was a dragon lake.<note id="n502.3.a" n="A">Kashmir has still a trace of Gandh&#225;ra.

What sense have these tales? In a hilly land where the people live in valleys the river is at once the most whimsical and the most dangerous force. Few seasons pass in which the river does not either damage with its floods or with its failure and at times glaciers and landslips stop the entire flow and the valley is ruined. So great and so strange an evil as the complete drying of a river must be the result of some one&#8217;s will, of some one&#8217;s temper. The Dragon is angry he wants a sacrifice. Again the river ponds into a lake, the lake tops the earth bank and rushes in a flood wasting as only a dragon can waste. For generations after so awful a proof of power all doubts regarding dragons are dead. (Compare Drew&#8217;s Cashmere and Jummoo, 414&#8211;421.) In India the Chinese dragon turns into a cobra. In China the cobra is unknown: in India than the cobra no power is more dreaded. How can the mighty unwieldy dragon be the little silent cobra. How not? Can the dragon be worshipful if he is unable to change his shape. To the spirit not to the form is worship due. Again the worshipped dragon becomes the guardian. The great earth Bodhisattva transforms himself into a N&#225;gar&#225;ja and dwells in lake Anavatapta whose flow of cool water enriches the world (Buddhist Records, II. 11). In a fane in Sw&#225;t Buddha takes the form of a dragon and the people live on him (125). A pestilence wasted Sw&#225;t. Buddha becomes the serpent Suma, all who taste his flesh are healed of the plague (126). A N&#225;ga maiden, who for her sins has been born in serpent shape and lives in a pool, loves Buddha who was then a &#346;akya chief. Buddha&#8217;s merit regains for the girl her lost human form. He goes into the pool slays the girl&#8217;s snake-kin and marries her. Not even by marriage with the &#346;akya is her serpent spirit driven out of the maiden. At night from her head issues a nine-crested N&#225;ga. &#346;akya strikes off the nine crests and ever since that blow the royal family has suffered from headaches (132). This last tale shows how Buddhism works on the coarser and fiercer tribes who accept its teaching. The converts rise to be men though a snake-head may peep out to show that not all of the old leaven is dead. In other stories Buddha as the sacramental snake shows the moral advance in Buddhism from fiend to guardian worship. The rest of the tales illustrate the corresponding intellectual progress from force worship to man, that is mind, worship. The water force sometimes kindly and enriching sometimes fierce and wasting becomes a Bodhisattva always kindly though his goodwill may have to give way to the rage of evil powers. So Br&#225;hmanism turns N&#225;r&#225;yana the sea into &#346;iva or Somn&#225;th the sea ruler. In this as in other phases religion passes from the worship of the forces of Nature to which in his beginnings man has to bow to the worship of Man or conscious Mind whose growth in skill and in knowledge has made him the Lord of the forces. These higher ideals are to a great extent a veneer. The Buddhist evangelist may dry the lake; he is careful to leave a pool for the N&#225;gar&#225;ja. In times of trouble among the fierce struggles of pioneers and settlers the spirit of Buddha withdraws and leaves the empty shrine to the earlier and the more immortal spirit of Force, the N&#225;gar&#225;ja who has lived on in the pool which for the sake of peace Buddha refrained from drying.</p></note>

Still so marked an increase makes it probable that with some of the great fifth and sixth century conquerors of Baktria K&#225;bul and the Panj&#225;b, of whom a trace may remain in the snake-worshipping <pb id="pb504" n="504"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix IV.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Cambodia.</hi></item></list> </fw>N&#225;gas and Takkas of the Kamaon and Garhwal hills, the Dragon was the chief object of worship. Temple remains show that the seventh and eighth century rulers of Kashmir, with a knowledge of classic architecture probably brought from beyond the Indus, were N&#225;ga worshippers.<note id="n504.1" n="1">Mr. Fergusson (Architecture, 219) places the K&#225;shmir temples between <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;600 and 1200 and allots M&#225;rtand the greatest to about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;750. The classical element, he says, cannot be mistaken. The shafts are fluted Grecian Doric probably taken from the Gandh&#225;ra monasteries of the fourth and fifth centuries. Fergusson was satisfied (Ditto, 289) that the religion of the builders of the K&#225;shmir temples was N&#225;ga worship. In Cambodia the Br&#225;hman remains were like those of Java (Ditto, 667). But the connection between the Nakhonwat series and the K&#225;shmir temples was unmistakeable (Ditto, 297, 665). N&#225;ga worship was the object of both (Ditto, 677&#8211;679). Imperfect information forced Fergusson to date the Nakhonwat not earlier than the thirteenth century (Ditto, 660, 679). The evidence of the inscriptions which (J. As. Ser. VI. Tom. XIX. page 190) brings back the date of this the latest of a long series of temples to the ninth and tenth centuries adds greatly to the probability of some direct connection between the builders of the M&#225;rtand shrine in K&#225;shmir and of the great Nakhonwat temple at Angkor.</note> The fact that the ninth century revision of religion in Tibet came mainly from Kashmir and that among the eighteen chief gods of the reformed faith the great Serpent had a place favours the view that through Tibet passed the scheme and the classic details of the Kashmir N&#225;ga temples which in greater wealth and splendour are repeated in the Nakhonwat of Angkor in Cambodia.<note id="n504.2" n="2"><abbr>Ency. Brit.</abbr> <abbr>Art.</abbr> Tibet, 344.</note> It is true that the dedication of the great temple to N&#225;ga worship before the Siamese priests filled it with statues of Buddha is questioned both by Lieut. Garnier and by Sir H. Yule.<note id="n504.3" n="3"><abbr>Ency. Brit.</abbr> <abbr>Art.</abbr> Cambodia.</note> In spite of this objection and though some of the series have been Buddhist from the first, it is difficult to refuse acceptance to Mr. Fergusson&#8217;s conclusions that in the great N&#225;khon, all traces of Buddhism are additions. The local conditions and the worshipful Tale Sap lake favour this conclusion. What holier dragon site can be imagined than the great lake Tale Sap, 100 miles by 30, joined to the river Mekong by a huge natural channel which of itself empties the lake in the dry season and refills it during the rains giving a water harvest of fish as well as a land harvest of grain. What more typical work of the dragon as guardian water lord. Again not far off <corr sic="betwen">between</corr> Angkor and Yunn&#225;n was the head-quarters of the dragon as the unsquared fiend. In Carrajan ten days west of the city of Yachi Marco Polo (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1290) found a land of snakes and great serpents ten paces in length with very great heads, eyes bigger than a loaf of bread, mouths garnished with pointed teeth able to swallow a man whole, two fore-legs with claws for feet and bodies equal in bulk to a great cask. He adds: &#8216;These serpents devour the cubs of lions and bears without the sire and dam being able to prevent it. Indeed if they catch the big ones they devour them too: no one can make any resistance. Every man and beast stands in fear and trembling of them.&#8217; Even in these fiend dragons was the sacramental guardian element. The gall from their inside healed the bite of a mad dog, delivered a woman in hard labour, and cured itch or it might be worse. Moreover, he concludes, the flesh of these serpents is excellent eating and toothsome.<note id="n504.4" n="4">Yule&#8217;s Marco Polo, II. 45, 47.</note>

Of the three Sub&#225;ra (Surab&#225;ra or Surat), Sind&#225;n (the Th&#225;na Sanj&#225;n), and Saim&#250;r (Cheul), he says Saim&#250;r alone belongs to the Balh&#225;ra, whose kingdom, he adds, is large, well-peopled, commercial, and fertile. Near Sub&#225;ra (apparently Surab&#225;ra) he locates small islands which he styles B&#225;ra where, he adds, cocoanuts and the costus grow.<note id="n509.7" n="7">Sir H. Elliot&#8217;s History of India, I. 85.</note> East of Sind&#225;n, due to a confusion between Sandh&#225;n in Kachh and Sanj&#225;n in Th&#225;na, he places another island bearing the same name as the port and under the same government as the mainland, highly cultivated and producing the cocoa palm the bamboo and the cane. Five miles by sea from Kul&#225;mmali lies another island called M&#225;li, an elevated plateau, but not hilly, and covered with vegetation. The mention of the pepper vine suggests that Al Idr&#237;si has wandered to the Malab&#225;r Coast. In the eighth section of the second clime Al Idr&#237;si places B&#225;r&#250;h (Broach), Sand&#225;p&#250;r (apparently Goa), T&#225;na (Th&#225;na), Kand&#225;rina (Gandh&#225;r, north of Broach), Jirb&#225;tan a town mentioned by Al Idr&#237;si as the nearest in a voyage from Ceylon to the continent of India on that continent. It is described as a populous town on a river supplying rice and grain to Ceylon,<note id="n509.8" n="8">Elliot, I. 90&#8211;93.</note> Kalk&#225;yan, Luluwa, Kanja, and Samandir&#250;n, and in the interior Dulaka (Dholka), Janw&#225;l (Chunv&#225;l or Viramg&#225;m), and Nahrw&#225;r (Anhilw&#225;ra).<note id="n509.9" n="9">Elliot&#8217;s History of India, I. 89.</note> Opposite the sea-port of B&#225;r&#250;h (Broach), Al Idr&#237;si places an island called Mull&#225;n, producing large quantities of pepper.

The distance from B&#225;r&#250;h to Saim&#250;r he puts at two days journey, and that between B&#225;r&#250;h and <corr sic="Nahrwara">Nahrw&#225;ra</corr> (Anhilw&#225;ra) at eight days through a flat country travelled over in wheeled carriages drawn by oxen, which he adds furnished the only mode for the conveyance also of merchandise.

He represents all three of these towns to be centres of a considerable trade, and among their products mentions the bamboo and the cocoanut. From B&#225;r&#250;h to Sand&#225;b&#250;r (that is<corr>,</corr> Goa), a commercial town with fine houses and rich baz&#225;rs situated on a great gulf where ships cast anchor, the distance along the coast given by Al Idr&#237;si is four days. Al Kazw&#237;ni<note id="n510.1" n="1">Zakariah Ibni Muhammad Al Kazw&#237;ni, a native of Kazw&#237;n (Kasbin) in Persia, wrote his &#193;s&#225;r-ul-Bil&#225;d or &#8220;Signs or Monuments of Countries&#8221; about <hi rend='sc'>a.h.</hi>&#160;661 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1263) compiling it chiefly from the writings of Al Istakhri (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;951) and Ibni Haukal (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;976).

Al Kazw&#237;ni (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1230) dwells at length on the wonders of Somn&#225;th and its temple. He calls it a celebrated city of India situated on the shore of the sea and washed by its waves. Among its wonders is Somn&#225;th, an idol hung in space resting on nothing. In Somn&#225;th he says Hindus assemble by the ten thousand at lunar eclipses, believing that the souls of men meet there after separation from the body and that at the will of the idol they are re-born into other animals. The two centuries since its destruction by the idol-breaker of Ghaznah had restored Somn&#225;th to its ancient prosperity. He concludes his account of Somn&#225;th by telling how Mahm&#250;d ascertained that the chief idol was of iron and its canopy a loadstone and how by removing one of the walls the idol fell to the ground.

 </p><p><note place="margin">Rivers.</note>Regarding the rivers and streams of Gujar&#225;t the Arab writers are almost completely silent. The first reference to rivers is in Al Mas&#250;di (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;944) who in an oddly puzzled passage says:<note id="n510.2" n="2">Barbier De Meynard&#8217;s Text of Al Mas&#250;di&#8217;s Les Prairies D&#8217;Or, I. 382.</note> &#8220;On the L&#225;rwi Sea (Cambay and Cheul) great rivers run from the south whilst all the rivers of the world except the Nile of the Egypt, the Mehr&#225;n (Indus) of Sindh, and a few others flow from the north.&#8221; Al <corr sic="B&#237;r&#250;n&#237;">B&#237;r&#250;ni</corr> <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;970&#8211;1030) states that between the drainage areas of the Sarsut and the Ganges is the valley of the river Narmaza<note id="n510.3" n="3">Sir Henry Elliot misreads Tamraz for Al B&#237;r&#250;ni&#8217;s Arabic form of <hi>Narmaza</hi>.

The literal translation of the text of Al B&#237;r&#250;ni (see Sachau&#8217;s Al B&#237;r&#250;ni&#8217;s India, 130) is that given above: It is hard to believe that the accurate Al B&#237;r&#250;ni while in one place (see Sachau&#8217;s Text, 99) giving the name of the Narbada faultlessly, should in another place fall into the error of tracing it from <hi>Tirmiz</hi> a city of Central Asia. A comparison of Elliot&#8217;s version with the text sets the difficulty at rest. Compare Sir Henry Elliot&#8217;s History of India, I. 49 and note 3 ditto and Sachau&#8217;s Arabic Text of Al B&#237;r&#250;ni, 180 chapter 25.</note> which comes from the eastern mountains and flows south-west till it falls into the sea near Bahr&#250;ch about 180 miles (60 <hi>yojanas</hi>) east of Somn&#225;th. Another river the Sarsut (<corr sic="Sarasvati">Sarasvat&#237;</corr>) he rightly describes as falling into the sea an arrowshot to the east of Somn&#225;th.<note id="n510.4" n="4">Compare Sachau&#8217;s Al B&#237;r&#250;ni with Sir Henry Elliot, I. 49, who is silent as to the distance.</note> He further mentions the T&#225;bi (<corr sic="Tapti">T&#225;pti</corr>) from the Vindu or Vindhya hills and the T&#225;mbra Barani or copper-coloured, apparently also the T&#225;pti, as coming from M&#225;lwa.

Al Idr&#237;si (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1100) is the only other Arab writer who names any of the Gujar&#225;t rivers. As usual he is confused, describing Dulka (Dholka) as standing on the bank of a river flowing into the sea which forms an estuary or gulf on the east of which stands the town of B&#225;r&#250;h (Broach).<note id="n511.1" n="1">See Ahmed&#225;b&#225;d Gazetteer, IV. 338; also Elliot&#8217;s History of India, I. 356&#8211;357.</note>

 </p><p>The Arab writers record the following details of twenty-two leading towns:

Al Istakhri (<hi rend="sc">H.</hi> 340; <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;951) mentions &#193;mhal F&#225;mhal and K&#225;mhal, Ibni Haukal (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;976) F&#225;mhal K&#225;mhal and K&#225;muhal, and Al Idr&#237;si (end of the eleventh century) M&#225;mhul. That these are perversions of one name and that this town stood on the border of &#8216;Hind&#8217; or Gujar&#225;t (in contradistinction to Sindh) the position given to each by the Arab geographers<note id="n511.2" n="2">See Appendix Elliot&#8217;s History of India, I. 363.</note> places beyond question. Al Istakhri (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;951) alone calls the place by the name of &#193;mhal which he mentions<note id="n511.3" n="3">Al Istakhri in Elliot (History of India), I. 27.</note> as one of the chief cities of &#8216;Hind.&#8217; Later he gives the name of <hi>F&#225;mhal</hi> to a place forming the northern border of &#8220;<hi>Hind</hi>&#8221;, as all beyond it as far as Makr&#225;n belongs to Sindh. Again a little later<note id="n511.4" n="4">Al Istakhri in Elliot (History of India), I. 30.</note> he describes K&#225;mhal as a town eight days from Mans&#250;rah and four days from Kamb&#225;ya, thus making K&#225;mhal the first Gujar&#225;t town on the road from Mans&#250;rah about seventy miles north of Haidar&#225;b&#225;d in Sindh to Gujar&#225;t. Ibni Haukal (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;968&#8211;976) in his Ashk&#225;l-ul-Bil&#225;d gives F&#225;mhal in his text and K&#225;mhal in his map<note id="n511.5" n="5">Ibni Haukal in Elliot (History of India), I. 32&#8211;34.</note> and again while referring<note id="n511.6" n="6">Ibni Haukal in Elliot (History of India), I. 34&#8211;38.</note> to the desert between Makr&#225;n and F&#225;mhal as the home of the Meds, he styles it K&#225;mhal. Once more he refers to F&#225;mhal as a strong and great city, containing a J&#225;m&#225; or Assembly Mosque; a little later<note id="n511.7" n="7">Ibni Haukal in Elliot (History of India), I. 39.</note> he calls it K&#225;muhul and places it eight days from Mans&#250;rah and four from Kamb&#225;ya. He afterwards contradicts himself by making Mans&#250;rah two days&#8217; journey from &#8216;K&#225;muhul,&#8217; but this is an obvious error.<note id="n511.8" n="8">Ibni Haukal in Elliot (History of India), I. 40.</note> Al B&#237;r&#250;ni (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;970&#8211;1039) notices Anhilw&#225;ra and does not recognize any other form.<note id="n511.9" n="9">Al B&#237;r&#250;ni in Elliot (History of India), I. 61.</note> Al Idr&#237;si (end of the eleventh century) adopts no form but M&#225;mhal referring to it as one of the towns of the second climate<note id="n511.10" n="10">Al Idr&#237;si in Elliot (History of India), I. 77.</note> on the confines of a desert between Sindh and &#8220;Hind&#8221; (India or Gujar&#225;t) the home of the sheep-grazing and horse and camel-breeding Meds,<note id="n511.11" n="11">Al Idr&#237;si in Elliot (History of India), I. 79.</note> as a place numbered by some among the cities of Hind (Gujar&#225;t) by others as one of the cities of Sindh situated at the extremity of the desert which stretches between Kamb&#225;ya, Debal, and B&#225;nia.<note id="n511.12" n="12">B&#225;nia seems to be a copyist&#8217;s error for Baz&#225;na or N&#225;r&#225;yana.

He says Somn&#225;th was the greatest of all the idols of Hind. Pilgrims by the hundred thousand met at the temple especially at the times of eclipses and believed that the ebb and flow of the tide was the homage paid by the sea to the god. Everything of the most precious was brought to Somn&#225;th and the temple was endowed with more than 10,000 villages. Jewels of incalculable value were stored in the temple and to wash the idol water from the sacred stream of the Ganga was brought every day over a distance of two hundred <hi>farsangs</hi> (1200 miles). A thousand Br&#225;hmans were on duty every day in the temple, three hundred and fifty singers and dancers performed before the image, and three hundred barbers shaved the pilgrims who intended to pay their devotions at the shrine. Every one of these servants had a settled allowance. The temple of Somn&#225;th was built upon fifty pillars of teakwood covered with lead. The idol, which did not appear to be sculptured,<note id="n522.5" n="5">From the term &#8216;sculptured&#8217; it would seem the idol was of stone. It is curious how Ibni As&#237;r states a little further that a part of the idol was &#8220;burned by Mehm&#250;d.&#8221; See Elliot, II. 471. The T&#225;rikh-i-Alfi says (Elliot, II. 471) that the idol was cut of solid stone. It however represents it as hollow and containing jewels, in repeating the somewhat hackneyed words of Mahm&#250;d when breaking the idol regardless of the handsome offer of the Br&#225;hmans, and finding it full of jewels.</note> stood three cubits out of the ground and had a girth of three cubits. The idol was by itself in a dark chamber lighted by most exquisitely jewelled chandeliers. Near the idol was a chain of gold to which bells were hung weighing 200 <hi>mans</hi>. The chain was shaken at certain intervals during the night that the bells might rouse fresh parties of worshipping Br&#225;hmans. The treasury containing many gold and silver idols, with doors hung with curtains set with valuable jewels, was near the chamber of the idol. The worth of what was found in the temple exceeded two millions of <hi>d&#237;n&#225;rs</hi> (<abbr>Rs.</abbr> 1,00,00,000). According to Ibni As&#237;r Mahm&#250;d reached Somn&#225;th on a Thursday in the middle of <hi>Zilka&#225;da</hi> H. 414 (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;December 1023). On the approach of Mahm&#250;d Bh&#237;m the ruler of Anhilv&#225;&#7693; fled abandoning his capital and took refuge in a fort to prepare for war. From Anhilv&#225;&#7693; Mahm&#250;d started for Somn&#225;th taking several forts with images which, Ibni As&#237;r says, were the heralds <pb id="pb523" n="523"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix V.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Arab References</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;851&#8211;1350.</item><item>Port or Coast Towns.</item><item><hi>Somn&#225;th.</hi></item></list> </fw>or chamberlains of Somn&#225;th. Resuming his march he crossed a desert with little water. Here he was encountered by an army of 20,000 fighting men under chiefs who had determined not to submit to the invader. These forces were defeated and put to flight by a detachment sent against them by Mahm&#250;d. Mahm&#250;d himself marched to Dabalw&#225;rah a place said by Ibni As&#237;r to be two days journey from Somn&#225;th. When he reached Somn&#225;th Mahm&#250;d beheld a strong fortress whose base was washed by the waves of the sea. The assault began on the next day Friday. During nearly two days of hard fighting the invaders seemed doomed to defeat. On the third the Musalm&#225;ns drove the Hindus from the town to the temple. A terrible carnage took place at the temple-gate. Those of the defenders that survived took themselves to the sea in boats but were overtaken and some slain and the rest drowned.<note id="n523.1" n="1">The Rauzat-us-Safa (Lithgd.

The Rauz&#225;t-us-Safa says that when Mahm&#250;d had conquered <corr sic="Somnath">Somn&#225;th</corr> he wished to fix his residence there for some years as the country was very large and had a great many advantages including mines of pure gold and rubies brought from Sarand&#237;b or Ceylon which he represents as a dependency of Gujar&#225;t.

 </p><p>The merchant Sulaim&#225;n (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;851) ranks the Balh&#225;ra, the lord of M&#225;nk&#237;r, as the fourth of the great rulers of the world. Every prince in India even in his own land paid him homage. He was the owner of many elephants and of great wealth. He refrained from wine and paid his troops and servants regularly. Their favour to Arabs was famous. Abu Zaid (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;913) says that though the Indian kings acknowledge the supremacy of no one, yet the Balh&#225;ras or <corr sic="Rash&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as">R&#225;sh&#7789;rak&#250;&#7789;as</corr> by virtue of the title Balh&#225;ra are kings of kings.

Al Mas&#250;di (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;915) described Balh&#225;ra as a dynastic name which he who followed took. Though he introduces two other potentates the king of Jurz and the Ba&#251;ra or Parm&#225;r king of Kanauj fighting with each other and with the Balh&#225;ra he makes the Balh&#225;ra, the lord of the M&#225;nk&#237;r or the great centre, the greatest king <pb id="pb526" n="526"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix V.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Arab References</hi>, <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;851&#8211;1350.</item><item>Kings.</item></list> </fw>of India<note id="n526.1" n="1">Elliot&#8217;s History of India, I. 22, 24, 25.</note> to whom the kings of India bow in their prayers and whose emissaries they honour.

When Al Mas&#250;di was in Cambay the town was ruled by B&#225;nia, the deputy of the Balh&#225;ra. Al Istakhri (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;951) describes the land from Kamb&#225;yah to Saim&#250;r (Cheul) as the land of the Balh&#225;ra of M&#225;nk&#237;r. In the Konkan were many Musalm&#225;ns over whom the Balh&#225;ra appointed no one but a Musalm&#225;n to rule. Ibni Haukal (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;970) describes the Balh&#225;ra as holding sway over a land in which are several Indian kings.<note id="n526.2" n="2">Elliot&#8217;s History of India, I. 34.</note> Al Idr&#237;si (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;1100 but quoting Al Jauhari <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;950) agrees with Ibni Khurd&#225;dbah that Balh&#225;ra is a title meaning King of Kings. He says the title is hereditary in this country, where when a king ascends the throne he takes the name of his predecessor and transmits it to his heirs.<note id="n526.3" n="3">Elliot&#8217;s History of India, I. 86.</note>

He may not have known what excellent reasons the Gurjjaras had for hating the Arab raiders from sea and from Sindh. Nor would it strike him that the main reason why the Balh&#225;ra fostered the Moslem was the hope of Arab help in his struggles with the Gurjjaras.

He says that the inhabitants of Kamb&#225;ya are Buddhists (idolators)<note id="n531.6" n="6">Al Idr&#237;si in Elliot (History of India), I. 85.</note> and that the Balh&#225;ra also worships the idol Buddha.<note id="n531.7" n="7">Al Idr&#237;si in Elliot (History of India), I. 87.</note> The Indians, says Al Idr&#237;si<note id="n531.8" n="8">Sir Henry Elliot&#8217;s History of India, I. 88.</note> (end of the eleventh century) are naturally inclined to justice and in their actions never depart from it. Their reputation for good faith, honesty, and fidelity to their engagements brings strangers flocking to their country and aids its prosperity. In illustration of the peaceable disposition of the Hindus, he quotes the ancient practice of <hi>duh&#225;i</hi> or conjuring in the name of the king, a rite which is still in vogue in some native states. When a man has a rightful claim he draws a circle on the ground and asks his debtor to step into the circle in the name of the king. The debtor never fails to step in nor does he ever leave the circle without paying his debts. Al Idr&#237;si describes the people of Nahrw&#225;ra as having so high a respect for oxen that when an ox dies they bury it. &#8220;When enfeebled by age or if unable to work they provide their oxen with food without exacting any return.&#8221;<note id="n531.9" n="9">Al Idr&#237;si in Elliot (History of India), I. 88.</note>

From the description of these Pygmies (Ph&#244;tios. Bibl. LXXII. 11&#8211;12) it is evident that they represent the Bh&#237;ls. Kt&#234;sias also mentions (Ph&#244;tios. Bibl. LXXII. 8) that there is a place in an uninhabited region fifteen days from Mount Sardous, where they venerate the sun and moon and where for thirty-five days in each year the sun remits his heat for the comfort of his worshippers.

His general account of the manners of the Indians relates chiefly to those of northern India, of whom he had personal knowledge. But he also gave a geographical description of India, for Arrian informs us (Ind. VII) that he gave the total number of Indian tribes as 118, and Pliny (VI. 17ff) does in fact enumerate about 90, to whom may be added some seven or eight more mentioned by Arrian. It is true that Pliny does not distinctly state that he takes his geographical details from Megasthen&#234;s, and that he quotes Seneca as having written a book on India. But Seneca also (Pliny, VI. 17) gave the number of the tribes as 118 in which he must have followed Megasthen&#234;s. Further, Pliny says (<hi>ibid</hi><corr>.</corr>) that accounts of the military forces of each nation were given by writers such as Megasthen&#234;s and Dionysius who stayed with Indian kings: and as he does not mention Dionysius in his list of authorities for his Book VI., it follows that it was from Megasthen&#234;s that he drew his accounts of the forces of the Gangarid&#230;, Modogalinga, Andar&#230;, Prasi, Megall&#230;, Asmagi, Orat&#230;, Suaratarat&#230;, Automula, Charm&#230;, and Pand&#230; (VI. 19), names which, as will be shown below, betray a knowledge of all parts of India. It is a fair inference that the remaining names mentioned by Pliny were taken by him from Megasthen&#234;s, perhaps through the medium of Seneca&#8217;s work. The corruption of Pliny&#8217;s text <pb id="pb533" n="533"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix VI.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Early Greeks and Romans.</hi></item><item><hi>Megasthen&#234;s.</hi></item></list> </fw>and the fact that Megasthen&#234;s learnt the tribal names in their Prakrit forms, make it extremely difficult to identify many of the races referred to.

 </p><p>That part of Pliny&#8217;s account of India which may with some certainty be traced back to Megasthen&#234;s begins with a statement of the stages of the royal road from the Hypasis (Bi&#225;s) to Palibothra (Patna) (Nat. Hist. VI. 17). The next chapter gives an account of the Ganges and its tributaries and mentions the Gangarid&#230; of Kalinga with their capital Pertalis as the most distant nation on its banks. In the 19th chapter, after an account of the forces of the Gangarid&#230;, Pliny gives a list of thirteen tribes, of which the only ones that can be said to be satisfactorily identified are Modogalinga (the three Calingas: Caldwell Drav. Gr.), Molind&#230; (compare Mount M&#226;lindya of Var&#226;ha Mihira Br. S. XIV.), and Thalut&#230; (McCrindle reads Taluct&#230; and identifies with the T&#226;mraliptakas of Tamluk on the lower Ganges). He next mentions the Andar&#230; (Andhras of Telingana) with thirty cities 100,000 foot 2000 horse and 1000 elephants. He then digresses to speak of the Dard&#230; (Dards of the Upper Indus) as rich in gold and the Set&#230; (of M&#234;w&#226;r, Lassen) in silver, and next introduces the Prasi (Pr&#226;cyas) of Palibothra (<corr sic="P&#226;taliputra">P&#226;&#7789;aliputra</corr>) as the most famous and powerful of all the tribes, having 600,000 foot 30,000 horse and 8000 elephants. Inland from these he names the Mon&#230;des (Mu&#7751;&#7693;a of Singbh&#250;m) and Suari (&#346;avaras of Central India) among whom is Mount Maleus (Mahendra Male?). Then after some account of the Iomanes (Yamun&#226;) running between Methora (Mathur&#226;) and Chrysobora (McCrindle reads Carisobora, Arrian Ind. VIII. Kleisobora = K&#7771;ish&#7751;apura?) he turns to the Indus, of some of whose nineteen tributaries he gives some account in chapter 20. He then digresses to give an account of the coast of India, starting from the mouth of the Ganges, whence to Point Calingon (Point God&#226;vari) and the city of Dandaguda (Cunningham&#8217;s R&#226;ja Mahendri, but more probably the Dhanaka&#7789;aka or Dhenuk&#226;ka&#7789;a of the Western cave inscriptions) he reckons 625 miles. The distance thence to Tropina (Tirupanatara near Kochin according to Burgess) is 1225 miles. Next at a distance of 750 miles is the cape of Perimula, where is the most famous mart of India. Further on in the same chapter is mentioned a city named Automula on the sea shore among the Arabastr&#230; (or Salabastr&#230; and Orat&#230;, McCrindle) a noble mart where five rivers together flow into the sea. There can hardly be a doubt that the two places are the same, the two names being taken from different authorities, and that the place meant is Chemula or Cheul (Ptolemy&#8217;s Simulla) the five rivers being those that flow into Bombay Harbour northward of Cheul. The distance from Perimula to the Island of Patala in the Indus is 620 miles. Pliny next enumerates as hill tribes between the Indus and Jamna, shut in a ring of mountains and deserts for a space of 625 miles, the C&#230;si (the Keki&#7885;i of Arr. Ind. IV. and K&#234;kayas of the Pur&#226;&#7751;as, about the head waters of the Sutlej), the Cetriboni of the woods (... Vana?), the Megall&#230; (M&#234;kalas) with 500 elephants and unknown numbers of horse and foot, the Chrysei (Kar&#251;sha) Parasang&#230; (P&#226;ra&#347;ava, corrupted by the likeness of its first three syllables to the word <choice><orig><foreign lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#945;</foreign></orig><reg type="trans"><foreign lang="grc-latn" xml:lang="grc-latn">parasanga</foreign></reg></choice>, the Asmagi (A&#347;maka of Var&#226;ha Mihira) with 30,000 foot 300 elephants and 800 horse. These are shut in by the Indus and surrounded by a circle of mountains and deserts for 625 miles. Next come the Dari and Sur&#230; and then deserts again for 187 miles. Whether these are or are not correctly identified with the Dhars and Saurs of Sindh, they must be placed somewhere to the north of the Ran. Below them come five kingless tribes living in the hills along the sea-coast&#8212;the <pb id="pb534" n="534"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix VI.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Early Greeks and Romans.</hi></item><item><hi>Megasthen&#234;s.</hi></item></list> </fw>Maltecor&#230;, Singh&#230;, Maroh&#230;, Rarung&#230;, and Moruni&#8212;none of whom are satisfactorily identified, but who may be placed in Kachh. Next follow the Nare&#230;, enclosed by Mount Capitalia (&#194;bu) the highest mountain in India, on the other side of which are mines of gold and silver. The identification of Capitalia with &#194;bu is probable enough, but the name given to the mountain must be connected with the Kapish&#7789;hala of the <hi>Pur&#226;&#7751;as</hi>, who have given their name to one of the recensions of the Yajur Veda, though Kaithal, their modern representative, lies far away from &#194;bu in the Karn&#226;l district of the Panj&#226;b, and Arrian places his <choice><orig><foreign lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#954;&#945;&#956;&#946;&#953;&#963;&#952;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#953;</foreign></orig><reg type="trans"><foreign lang="grc-latn" xml:lang="grc-latn">kambistholoi</foreign></reg></choice> (Ind. IV) about the head waters of the Hydra&#244;t&#234;s (R&#226;v&#238;). After Capitalia and the Nare&#230; come the Orat&#230; with but ten elephants but numerous infantry. These must be the Apar&#226;ntakas of the inscriptions and <hi>pur&#226;&#7751;as</hi>, Megasthen&#234;s having learnt the name in a <corr sic="Prak&#7771;it">Pr&#226;k&#7771;it</corr> form (Avar&#226;ta, Or&#226;ta). The name of the next tribe, who have no elephants but horse and foot only, is commonly read Suaratarat&#230; (Nobbe) but the preferable reading is Varetat&#230; (McCrindle) which when corrected to Varelat&#230; represents Varalatta, the sixth of the seven Konkans in the pur&#226;&#7751;ic lists (Wilson <abbr>As. Res.</abbr> XV. 47), which occupied the centre of the Th&#225;na district and the country of the wild tribe of the Varl&#238;s. Next are the Odonb&#230;ores, whose name is connected with the <hi>udumbara</hi> Ficus glomerata tree, and who are not the Audumbari S&#226;lvas of <corr sic="P&#226;ni&#7751;i">P&#226;&#7751;ini</corr> (IV. i. 173) but must be placed in Southern Th&#225;na. Next come the Arabastr&#230; Orat&#230; (so read for Arabastr&#230; Thorace of Nobbe, and Salabastr&#230; Horat&#230; of McCrindle) or Arabastra division of the Orat&#230; or Kon&#775;ka&#7751;&#238;s. Arabastra may be connected with the &#194;rava of Var&#226;ha-Mihira&#8217;s South-Western Division (<abbr>Br. S.</abbr> XIV. 17) where they are mentioned along with Barbara (the seventh or northernmost Kon&#775;ka&#7751;). This tribe had a fine city in a marsh infested by crocodiles and also the great mart of Automula (Cheul) at the confluence of five rivers, and the king had 1600 elephants 150,000 foot and 5000 horse, and must therefore have held a large part of the Dakhan as well as of the sea coast. Next to this kingdom is that of the Charm&#230;, whose forces are small, and next to them the Pand&#230; (P&#226;&#7751;&#7693;ya of Travancor) with 300 cities 150,000 foot and 500 elephants. Next follows a list of thirteen tribes, some of which St. Martin has identified with modern <corr sic="Rajput">R&#226;jput</corr> tribes about the Indus, because the last name of the thirteen is Orostr&#230;, &#8220;who reach to the island of Patala,&#8221; and may be confidently identified with the <corr sic="S&#226;ur&#226;sh&#7789;ra">Saur&#226;sh&#7789;ra</corr> of K&#226;thi&#226;v&#226;&#7693;a. We must however assume that Megasthen&#234;s after naming the tribes of the west coast enumerates the inland tribes of the Dakhan until he arrives at the point from which he started. But the only identification that seems plausible is that of the Derang&#230; with the Telingas or Telugus. Next to the Orostr&#230; follows a list of tribes on the east of the Indus from south to north&#8212;the Matho&#230; (compare M&#226;nthava, a B&#226;h&#238;ka town P&#226;n. IV. ii. 117), Boling&#230; (Bh&#226;ulingi, a S&#226;lva tribe P&#226;n. IV. i. 173), Gallitalut&#230; (perhaps a corruption of T&#226;ilakhali, another S&#226;lva tribe, <hi>ib.</hi>), Dimuri, Megari, Ardab&#230;, Mes&#230; (Matsya of Jaipur?), Abi, Suri, (v. 1. Abhis Uri), Sil&#230;, and then deserts for 250 miles. Next come three more tribes and then again deserts, then four or five (according to the reading) more tribes, and the Asini whose capital is Bucephala (Jal&#226;lpur) (Cunningham <abbr>Anc. Geog.</abbr> 177). Megasthen&#234;s then gives two mountain tribes and ten beyond the Indus including the Orsi (Ura&#347;&#226;) Taxil&#230; (Taksha&#347;il&#226;) and Peucolit&#230; (people of Pushk&#226;lavat&#238;). Of the work of D&#234;&#239;machos, who went on an embassy to Allitrochad&#234;s (Bindus&#226;ra) son of Candragupta, nothing is known except that it was in two books and was reckoned the most untrustworthy of all accounts of India (Strabo, II. i. 9).

He also sent to India (apparently to A&#347;oka) an envoy named Dionysius, who is said by Pliny (VI. 17) to have written an account of things Indian of which no certain fragments appear to remain.

Gr. Min. I. 111ff), states that in his time the Indian trade with Potana (Patala) was in the hands of the Sab&#230;ans of Yemen. (M&#252;ller, I. 191.) In fact it was not until the voyages of Eudoxos (see below) that any direct trade sprang up between India and Egypt. The mention of Patala as the mart resorted to by the Arabs shows that we are still in Pliny&#8217;s first period (see below).

But the most extensive conquests to the east and south were made by Menandros (c. 110 <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>) who advanced to the Jumna and conquered the whole coast from Pattal&#234;n&#234; (lower Sindh) to the kingdoms of Saraostos (<corr sic="&#7778;ur&#226;sh&#7789;ra">Sur&#226;sh&#7789;ra</corr>) and Sigertis (Pliny&#8217;s Sigerus?) (Strabo, XI. ii. 1). These statements of Strabo are confirmed by the author of the Periplus (c. 250 <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>) who says that in his time <hi>drakhmai</hi> with Greek inscriptions of Menandros and Apollodotos were still current at Barygaza (Per. 47). Apollodotos is now generally thought to have been the successor of Menandros (<hi rend="sc">C.</hi> 100 <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>) (Brit. Museum Cat. of Bactrian Coins page xxxiii.). Plutarch (<foreign lang="la" xml:lang="la">Reip. Ger.

Strabo (II. iii. 4), in quoting the story of his doings from Poseid&#244;nios, lays more stress upon his attempt to circumnavigate Africa than upon these two Indian voyages, but they are of very great importance as the beginnings of the direct trade with India.

 </p><p><note place="margin"><hi><corr sic="Eratokthen&#234;s">Eratosthen&#234;s</corr>.</hi></note><hi rend="bold">The Geographers</hi> down to Ptolemy drew their knowledge of India almost entirely from the works of Megasthen&#234;s and of the companions of Alexander. Among them Eratosthen&#234;s (c. 275&#8211;194 <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>), the founder of scientific geography, deserves mention as having first given wide currency to the notion that the width of India from west to east was greater than its length from north to south, an error which lies at the root of Ptolemy&#8217;s distortion of the map. Eratosthen&#234;s&#8217; critic Hipparkhos (c. 130 <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>) on this point followed the more correct account of Megasthen&#234;s, and is otherwise notable as the first to make use of astronomy for the determination of the geographical position of places.

With these envoys came a certain Zarmanokh&#234;gas (&#346;rama&#7751;&#226;c&#226;rya, Lassen) from Bargos&#234; (Broach, the earliest mention of the name) who afterwards burnt himself at Athens, &#8220;according to the ancestral custom of the Indians.&#8221; The fact that the embassy came from Broach and passed through Antioch shows that they took the route by the Persian Gulf, which long remained one of the chief lines of trade (<abbr>Per.</abbr> <abbr expan="chapter">chap.</abbr> 36). If the embassy was not a purely commercial speculation on the part of merchants of Broach, it is hard to see how king P&#244;ros, who had 600 under-kings, can be other than the Indo-Skythian Kozolakadaphes, who held P&#244;ros&#8217; old kingdom as well as much other territory in North-West India. This if correct would show that as early as the beginning of our era the Indo-Skythian power reached as far south as Broach. The fact that the embassy took the Persian Gulf route and that their object was to open commercial relations with the Roman empire seems to show that at this period there was no direct trade between Broach and the Egyptian ports of the Red Sea. Strabo however mentions that in his time Arabian and Indian wares were carried on camels from Myos Hormos (near R&#226;s Abu Somer) on the Red Sea to Koptos on the Nile (XVII. i. 45 and XVI. iv. 24) and dilates upon the increase of the Indian trade since the days of the Ptolemies when not so many as twenty ships dared pass through the Red Sea &#8220;to peer out of the Straits,&#8221; whereas in his time whole fleets of as many as 120 vessels voyaged to India and the headlands of Ethiopia from Myos Hormos (II. v. 12 and XV. i. 13). It would seem that we have here to do with Pliny&#8217;s second period of Indian trade, when Sigerus (probably Janjira) was the goal of the Egyptian shipmasters (see below). Strabo learnt these particulars during his stay in Egypt with Aelius Gallus, but they were unknown to his contemporary Diod&#244;ros who drew his account of India entirely from Megasthen&#234;s (Diod. II. 31&#8211;42) and had no knowledge of the East beyond the stories told by Jamboulos a person of uncertain date of an island in the Indian Archipelago (Bali, according to Lassen) (Diod. II. 57&#8211;60). Pomponius Mela (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;43) also had no recent information as regards India.

 </p><p><note place="margin"><hi>Pliny.</hi></note><hi rend="bold">Pliny</hi> (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;23&#8211;79) who published his Natural History in <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;77 gives a fairly full account of India, chiefly drawn from Megasthen&#234;s (see above). He also gives two valuable pieces of contemporary information:

 </p><p>(i) An account of Ceylon (Taproban&#234;) to which a freedman of Annius Plocamus, farmer of the Red Sea tribute, was carried by stress of weather in the reign of Claudius (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;41&#8211;54). On his return the king sent to the emperor four envoys, headed by one Rachias (VI. 22).

 </p><p>(ii) An account of the voyage from Alexandria to India by a course which had only lately been made known (VI. 23). Pliny divides the history of navigation from the time of Nearchus to his own age into three periods:

 <list type="simple"><item>(<hi>a</hi>) the period of sailing from Syagrus (R&#226;s Fartak) in Arabia to Patal&#234; (Indus delta) by the south-west wind called Hippalus, 1332 miles;

From Okelis it is a forty days&#8217; voyage to Muziris (Muyyiri, Kranganur) which is dangerous on account of the neighbouring pirates of Nitrias (Mangalor) and inconvenient by reason of the distance of the roads from the shore. Another better port is Becare (Kalla&#7693;a, Yule) belonging to the tribe Neacyndon (<hi>Ptol.</hi> Melkynda, <hi>Peripl.</hi> Nelkynda) of the kingdom of Pandion (P&#226;&#7751;&#7693;ya) whose capital is Modura (Madura).

 </p><p>It is clear that the modern improvement in navigation on which Pliny lays so much stress consisted, not in making use of the monsoon wind, but in striking straight across the Indian ocean to the Malabar coast. The fact that the ships which took this course carried a guard of archers in Pliny&#8217;s time, but not in that of the Periplus, is another indication that the direct route to Malabar was new and unfamiliar in the first century <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi> The name Hippalus given to the monsoon wind will be discussed below in dealing with the Periplus.

 </p><p><note place="margin"><hi>Klaudios Ptolemaios.</hi></note><hi rend="bold">Klaudios Ptolemaios</hi> of Alexandria lived according to Suidas under Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;161&#8211;180). He compiled his account of India as part of a geographical description of the then known world, and drew much of his materials from Marinos of Tyre, whose work is lost, but who must have written about <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;130. Ptolemy (or Marinos before him) had a very wide knowledge of India, drawn partly from the relations of shipmasters and traders and partly from Indian lists similar to those of the <hi><corr sic="Pur&#226;nas">Pur&#226;&#7751;as</corr></hi> but drawn up in Pr&#226;k&#7771;it. He seems to have made little if any use of Megasthen&#234;s and the companions of Alexander. But his map of India is distorted by the erroneous idea, which he took from Eratosthen&#234;s, that the width of India from west to east greatly exceeded its length from north to south. Ptolemy begins his description of India with the first chapter of his seventh book, which deals with India within the Ganges. He gives first the names of rivers, countries, towns, and capes along the whole coast of India from the westernmost mouth of the Indus to the easternmost mouth of the Ganges. He next mentions in detail the mountains and the rivers with their tributaries, and then proceeds to enumerate the various nations of India and the cities belonging to each, beginning with the north-west and working southwards: and he finally gives a list of the islands lying off the coast. In dealing with his account of western India it will be convenient to notice together the cities of each nation which he mentions separately under the heads of coast and inland towns.

 </p><p>He gives the name of Indo-Skythia to the whole country on both sides of the lower course of the Indus from its junction with the Koa (K&#225;bul river), and gives its three divisions as Patal&#234;n&#234; (lower Sindh) Abiria (read Sabiria, that is Sauv&#238;ra or upper Sindh and <corr sic="Multan">Mult&#226;n</corr>) and Surastr&#234;n&#234; (Sur&#226;sh&#7789;ra or <corr sic="K&#226;thi&#226;v&#226;da">K&#226;thi&#226;v&#226;&#7693;a</corr>). We have seen that Dionysios knew the southern Skythians of the Indus, and we shall meet with them again in the Periplus (chapter 38ff).

Only it may be noted that Sinth&#244;n preserves the Indian name of the river (Sindhu) and that the easternmost mouth (L&#244;nibare) probably represents both the present Kor&#238; or Laun&#238; and the L&#251;n&#238; river of M&#226;rw&#226;r, a fact which goes some way to explain why Ptolemy had no idea of the existence of Kachh, though he knows the Ran as the gulf of Kanthi. Hence he misplaces Surastr&#234;n&#234; (Sur&#226;sh&#7789;ra or K&#226;thi&#226;v&#226;&#7693;a) in the Indus delta instead of south of the Ran. Ptolemy enumerates a group of five towns in the north-western part of Indo-Skythia (Kohat, Bannu, and Dera Ismail Kh&#226;n) of which Cunningham (<abbr>Anc. Geog.</abbr> pages 84ff) has identified Banagara with Bannu, and Andrapana with Daraban, while the sites of Artoarta, Sabana, and Kodrana are unknown. Ptolemy next gives a list of twelve towns along the western bank of the Indus to the sea. Of these Embolima has been identified by Cunningham (<abbr>Anc. Geog.</abbr> page 52) with Amb sixty miles above Attok, and Pasip&#234;da is identified by St. Martin with the Besmaid of the Arab geographers and placed near Mithankot at the junction of the Chenab with the Indus. Sousikana, which comes next in the list to Pasip&#234;&#7693;a, is generally thought to be a corruption of Mousikanos, and is placed by the latest authority (General Haig, <hi>The Indus Delta Country</hi>, page 130) in <corr sic="Bahawalpur">Bah&#226;walpur</corr>, though Cunningham (<abbr>Anc. Geog.</abbr> page 257) puts it at Alor, which is somewhat more in accordance with Ptolemy&#8217;s distances. K&#244;laka the most southerly town of the list, cannot well be the Kr&#244;kala of Arrian (Kar&#226;chi) as McCrindle supposes, for Ptolemy puts it nearly a degree north of the western mouth of the Indus.

 </p><p>The two great towns of the delta which Ptolemy next mentions, are placed by General Haig, Patala at a point thirty-five miles south-east of Haidar&#226;b&#226;d (<hi>op. cit.</hi> page 19) and Barbarei near Sh&#226;h Bandar (<hi>op. cit.</hi> page 31). Barbarei is mentioned again in the Periplus (chapter 38) under the name of Barbarikon. Ptolemy gives the names of nine towns on the left bank of the Indus from the confluence to the sea, but very few of them can be satisfactorily identified. Panasa can only be Osanpur (St. Martin) on Fluellen&#8217;s principles. Boudaia must represent the Budh&#238;ya of the Arabs, though it is on the wrong side of the river (see Haig, <hi>op. cit.</hi> page 57ff). Naagramma may with Yule be placed at Naushahro. Kamigara cannot be Aror (McCrindle), if that place represents Sousikana. Binagara is commonly thought to be a corrupt reading of Minnagara (compare Periplus chapter 38). Haig (<hi>op. cit.</hi> page 32 note 47) refers to the Tuhfatu&#8217;l Kir&#226;m as mentioning a Minnagar in pargana Sh&#226;hd&#226;dpur (north-east of Haidar&#226;b&#226;d). Parabali, Sydros, and Epitausa have not been identified, but must be looked for either in Haidar&#226;b&#226;d or in Thar and P&#226;rkar. Xoana may with Yule be identified with Siwana in the bend of the L&#251;n&#238; and gives another indication that Ptolemy confounded the L&#251;n&#238; with the eastern mouth of the Indus.

 </p><p>On the coast of Surastr&#234;n&#234; (K&#226;thi&#226;v&#226;&#7693;a) Ptolemy mentions, first, the island of Barak&#234; (Dv&#226;rak&#226; B&#234;t): then the city Bardax&#234;ma which must be Porbandar (Yule), in front of the Barada hills: then the village of Surastra, which perhaps represents Ver&#226;val, though it is placed too far north. Surastra cannot well be Jun&#226;gad (Lassen) which is not on the coast and in Ptolemy&#8217;s time was not a village, but a city, though it is certainly strange that Ptolemy does not anywhere mention it. Further south Ptolemy places the mart of Monogl&#244;sson (Mangrol). The eastern <pb id="pb539" n="539"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix VI.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Early Greeks and Romans.</hi></item><item><hi>Klaudios Ptolemaios.</hi></item></list> </fw>boundary of the coast of Indo-Skythia seems to have been the mouth of the M&#244;phis (Mah&#238;). Ptolemy&#8217;s account of Indo-Skythia may be completed by mentioning the list of places, which he puts to the east of the Indus (<hi>i. e.</hi> the L&#251;n&#238;) and at some distance from it.

 </p><p>These are: Xodrak&#234;, which has not been identified, but which must be placed somewhere in Mew&#226;r, perhaps at the old city of P&#251;r, seventy-two miles north-east of Udaipur, or possibly at the old city of Ahar, two miles from Udaipur itself (Tod&#8217;s R&#226;jasth&#226;n, I. 677&#8211;78).

 </p><p>Sarbana, which is marked in Ptolemy&#8217;s map at the head-waters of the Mah&#238; in the Apokopa mountains (Aravallis), must be identified with Sarwan about ten miles north-west of Ratl&#226;m. There is also a place called Sarwanio close to Nimach, which Ptolemy may have confused with Sarwan.

 </p><p>Auxoamis, which St. Martin identifies with S&#251;m&#238;, and Yule with Ajmir, but neither place suits the distance and direction from Sarwan. If Ptolemy, as above suggested, confused Sarwan and Sarwanio, Auxoamis may be Ahar near Udaipur, P&#251;r being then Xodrak&#234;: otherwise Auxoamis may be &#205;dar. The question can only be settled by more exact knowledge of the age of Ahar and of &#205;dar. Orbadarou may provisionally with Yule be placed at &#194;bu.

 </p><p>Asinda must be looked for near Sidhpur, though it cannot with St. Martin be identified with that place. Perhaps Vadnagar (formerly &#194;nandapura and a very old town) may be its modern representative.

 </p><p>Theophila may be Devaliya (Yule) or Th&#226;n (Burgess) in north-east K&#226;thi&#226;v&#226;&#7693;a.

 </p><p>Astakapra is admitted to be Hastakavapra or H&#226;thab near Bh&#226;vnagar (B&#252;hler).

 </p><p><hi>Larik&#234;</hi> is described by Ptolemy next after Indo-Skythia on his way down the West Coast. The northern limit of its coast was the mouth of the river M&#244;phis (Mah&#238;). Its name is the L&#226;&#7789;a of <hi>pur&#226;&#7751;as</hi> and inscriptions. Ptolemy mentions as on its coast the village of Pakidar&#234;, which may be a misreading for K&#226;pidar&#234; and represent K&#226;v&#238; (K&#226;pik&#226; of inscriptions) a holy place just south of the Mah&#238;. Next comes Cape Male&#244;, which Ptolemy both in his text and in his map includes in Larik&#234;, though there is no prominent headland in a suitable position on the east side of the Gulf of Cambay. As he puts it 2&#188; degrees west of Broach, it may probably be identified with <corr sic="G&#244;pn&#226;th">Gopn&#226;th</corr> Point in K&#226;thi&#226;v&#226;&#7693;a on the other side of the gulf (the P&#226;pik&#234; of the Periplus), his name for it surviving in the neighbouring shoals known as the Malai banks. It is in agreement with this that Ptolemy puts the mouth of the river Namados (Narmad&#226;) to the north of Cape Male&#244;. South of the river is Kaman&#234; which may be identified with the Kamanijja or Karma&#7751;&#234;ya of inscriptions, that is with Kamlej on the Tapt&#238; above Surat. It has been supposed to be the Kamm&#244;ni of the Periplus (chapter 43), which was the village opposite to the reef called H&#234;r&#244;n&#234; on the right (east) of the gulf of Barygaza: but it is perhaps best to separate the two and to identify Kamm&#244;ni with Kim, north of Olp&#226;d. The next town mentioned is Nousaripa, which should probably be read Nousarika, being the Navas&#226;rik&#226; of inscriptions and the modern Naus&#226;r&#238;. The most southerly town of Larik&#234; is Poulipoula, which has been identified with Phulp&#226;d&#226; or old Surat, but is too far south. Bilimora is perhaps the most likely position for it, though the names do not correspond (unless Pouli is the Dravidian <hi>Puli</hi> or <hi>poli</hi> = a tiger, afterwards replaced by <hi>Bili</hi> = a cat). Ptolemy begins his list of the inland cities of Larik&#234; with Agrinagara, which may with Yule be identified with <pb id="pb540" n="540"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix VI.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Early Greeks and Romans.</hi></item><item><hi>Klaudios Ptolemaios.</hi></item></list> </fw>&#194;gar, thirty-five miles north-east of Ujjain, and the &#194;kara of inscriptions. The next town is Siripalla, which has not been identified, but should be looked for about thirty miles to the south-east of Agar, not far from Sh&#226;hjah&#226;npur. The modern name would probably be Shirol. Bammogoura must be identified, not with Pawangad (Yule), but with Hiuen Tsiang&#8217;s &#8220;city of the Br&#226;hmans&#8221; (Beal, Si-yu-ki, II. 262), 200 <hi>li</hi> (about 33 miles) to the north-west of the capital of M&#226;lava in his time. The distance and direction bring us nearly to Jaora. Sazantion and Zerogerei have not been satisfactorily identified but may provisionally be placed at Ratl&#226;m and Badnawar respectively, or Z&#234;rogerei may be Dh&#226;r as Yule suggested. Oz&#234;n&#234; the capital of Tiastan&#234;s is Ujjain the capital of the Kshatrapa Cash&#7789;ana who reigned c. 130 <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi> His kingdom included Western M&#226;lw&#226;, West <corr sic="Khandesh">Kh&#225;ndesh</corr>, and the whole of <corr sic="Guj&#225;rat">Gujar&#225;t</corr> south of the Mah&#238;. His grandson Rudrad&#226;man (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;150) tells us in his Girn&#226;r inscription (I. A. VII. 259) that his own kingdom included also M&#226;rw&#226;r Sindh and the lower Panj&#226;b. Next to Ujjain Ptolemy mentions Minnagara, which must have been somewhere near M&#226;npur. Then we come to Tiatoura or Ch&#226;ndor (Yule) on the ridge which separates <corr sic="Khandesh">Kh&#225;ndesh</corr> from the valley of the God&#226;vari, and finally on that river itself Nasika the modern N&#226;sik. It is very doubtful whether N&#226;sik at any time formed part of the dominions of Cash&#7789;ana, since we know from the inscriptions in the N&#226;sik caves that the Kshatrapas were driven out of that part of the country by Gautam&#238;putra &#346;&#226;takar&#7751;i, the father of Ptolemy&#8217;s contemporary Pulum&#226;yi. Ptolemy probably found N&#226;sik mentioned in one of his lists as on a road leading from Ujjain southwards and he concluded that they belonged to the same kingdom.

 </p><p><hi>Ariak&#234;</hi> of the Sadinoi included the coast of the Konkan as far south as Baltipatna (near Mah&#226;d) and the Deccan between the God&#226;vari and the K&#7771;ish&#7751;a. The name occurs in Var&#226;ha Mihira&#8217;s B&#7771;ihat Sam&#775;hit&#226; XIV. in the form &#194;ryaka. The tribal name Sadinoi is less easy to explain. The suggested connection with the word <hi>S&#226;dhana</hi> as meaning an agent (Lassen) and its application to the Kshatrapas of <corr sic="Gujarat">Gujar&#225;t</corr>, are not tenable. The only authority for this meaning of <hi>S&#226;dhana</hi> is Wilson&#8217;s Sanskrit Dictionary, and at this time it is certain that Ariak&#234; belonged, not to the Kshatrapas of <corr sic="Gujarat">Gujar&#225;t</corr>, but to the &#346;&#226;takar&#7751;is of Paithan on the God&#226;vari. Bh&#226;nd&#226;rkar&#8217;s identification of the Sadinoi with Var&#226;ha Mihira&#8217;s &#346;&#226;ntikas seems also somewhat unsatisfactory. Ptolemy&#8217;s name may possibly be a corruption of &#346;&#226;takar&#7751;i or &#346;&#226;tav&#226;hana. The coast towns of this region were Soupara (Sup&#226;r&#226; near Bassein), south of which Ptolemy places the river Goaris (Vaitara&#7751;&#238;), Dounga (perhaps Dug&#225;&#7693; ten miles north of Bhiwndi) south of which is the B&#234;nda river (Bhiwnd&#238; Creek), Simylla, a mart and a cape, the Automula and Perimula of Pliny and the modern Cheul (Chemula); Miliz&#234;gyris an island, the same as the Meliz&#234;igara of the Periplus and (probably) as the Sigerus of Pliny and the modern Janj&#238;ra; Hippokoura, either Ghodeg&#226;on or Ku&#7693;&#226; (Yule) in Kol&#226;b&#226; district; Baltipatna, probably the Palaipatmai of the Periplus and the same as P&#226;l near Mah&#226;d.

 </p><p>The inland dominions of the Sadinoi were much more extensive than their coast line. Ptolemy gives two lists of cities, one of those lying to the west (<hi>i. e.</hi> north) of the B&#234;nda, whose course in the Deccan represents the Bh&#238;m&#226; river, and the other of those between the B&#234;nda and the Pseudostomos (here the M&#226;lprabh&#226; and K&#7771;ish&#7751;a or possibly the Tungabhadra with its tributaries). The most easterly towns in the first list, Malippala and Sarisabis, are not satisfactorily identified, but must be looked for in the Niz&#226;m&#8217;s country to the south-east of <corr sic="Haid&#226;r&#226;b&#226;d">Haidar&#226;b&#226;d</corr><corr sic=",">.</corr> Next comes Tagara mentioned in the Periplus (chapter 51) as ten days east from Paithan, and <pb id="pb541" n="541"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix VI.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Early Greeks and Romans.</hi></item><item><hi>Klaudios Ptolemaios.</hi></item></list> </fw>therefore about the latitude of Kulbarga, with which it is identified by Yule. The distance and direction make its identification with Deogir (Wilford and others), Junnar (Bhagwanl&#226;l), or Kolh&#226;pur (Fleet) impossible. The best suggestion hitherto made is that it is D&#226;rur or Dh&#226;rur (Bh&#226;nd&#226;rkar), but D&#226;rur in the Bh&#238;r district is too far north, so Dh&#226;rur fifty miles west of Haidar&#226;b&#226;d must be taken as the most likely site. Next to Tagara Ptolemy mentions Baithana, which is the Paithana of the Periplus and the modern Paithan on the God&#226;vari. It is called by our author the capital of Siroptolemaios, who is the &#346;r&#238;-Pulum&#226;yi of the N&#226;sik cave inscriptions. Next to Baithana comes Deopali, which may safely be identified with the modern Deoli in the suburbs of Ahmadnagar. Gamaliba, the next stage, must be placed somewhere on the line between Ahmednagar and Junnar, which latter ancient town is to be identified with Ptolemy&#8217;s Om&#234;nogara, although this name is not easy to explain.

 </p><p>The second list of towns in Ariak&#234; begins with Nagarouris (Nagarapur&#238;) which probably represents Poona which even then must have been a place of importance, being at the head of the great road down the Bhorghat. Tabas&#244; (compare Var&#226;ha Mihira&#8217;s T&#226;pas&#226;&#347;r&#226;m&#226;h&#803; and Ptolemy&#8217;s own Tabasoi) may be the holy city of Pandharpur. Ind&#234; has retained its ancient name (Ind&#238; in the north of the <corr sic="Bijapur">B&#238;j&#226;pur</corr> district). Next follows Tiripangalida (T&#238;kota in the Kurundw&#226;d State&#160;?) and then Hippokoura, the capital of Baleokuros. Dr. Bh&#226;nd&#226;rkar has identified this king with the Viliv&#226;yak&#251;ra of coins found in the Kolh&#225;pur state. His capital may possibly be Hippargi in the Sindgi taluka of the B&#238;j&#226;pur district. Soubouttou, the next town on Ptolemy&#8217;s list, is not identifiable, but the name which follows, Sirimalaga, must be Sirn&#226;l in the B&#238;j&#226;pur taluka of the same district.

 </p><p>Kalligeris may be identified not with Ka&#7751;hagiri (McCrindle) but with Galgali at the crossing of the K&#7771;ish&#7751;a, and Modogoulla is not M&#251;dgal (McCrindle) but Mudhol on the Gh&#226;tprabh&#226;. Petirgala should probably read Penengala, and would then represent the old town of Panangala or Hongal in the Dh&#226;rv&#226;&#7693; district. The last name on the list is Banaouasei, which is Vanav&#226;s&#238;, about ten miles from Sirsi in Kanara, a very old town where a separate branch of the &#346;&#226;takar&#7751;is once ruled.

 </p><p><hi>The Pirate Coast</hi> is the next division of Western India described by Ptolemy, who mentions five sea-ports but only two inland cities. It is clear that the pirates were hemmed in on the land side by the dominions of the &#346;&#226;takar&#7751;is, and that they held but little territory above the gh&#226;ts, though their capital Mousopall&#234; was in that region. The places on the coast from north to south were Mandagara, the Mandagara of the Periplus (chapter 53) which has been satisfactorily identified with Mandanga&#7693; to the south of the B&#226;nkot creek.

 </p><p>Byzantion, which, as Dr. Bh&#226;nd&#226;rkar first pointed out, is the Vaijayant&#238; of inscriptions may be placed either at Chiplun or at <corr sic="Dabhol">D&#225;bhol</corr> at the mouth of the V&#226;sish&#7789;h&#238; river. Chiplun is the only town of great antiquity in this part of the Kon&#775;ka&#7751;, and if it is not Vaijayant&#238; Ptolemy has passed over it altogether. The similarity of the names has suggested the identification of Byzantion with Jayga&#7693; (Bh&#226;nd&#226;rkar) or Vijayadrug (Vincent), but both these places are comparatively modern. There are indeed no very ancient towns in the Kon&#775;ka&#7751; between San&#775;gam&#234;shvar and the S&#226;vantv&#226;&#7693;i border.

 </p><p>Kherson&#234;sos is generally admitted to be the peninsula of Goa.

 </p><p>The river Nanagouna here is generally supposed to be the K&#226;l&#238;nad&#238;, though in its upper course it seems to represent the Tapt&#238;, and a confusion with the N&#226;n&#226; pass led Ptolemy to bring it into connection with the rivers Goaris and B&#234;nda (Campbell).

 </p><p>Nitra, the southernmost mart on the pirate coast, is the Nitrias of Pliny, and has been satisfactorily identified by Yule with Mangalor on the N&#234;travat&#238;.

 </p><p>The inland cities of the Pirates are Olokhoira and Mousopall&#234; the capital, both of which must be sought for in the rugged country about the sources of the K&#7771;ish&#7751;a and may provisionally be identified with the ancient towns of Kar&#226;&#7693; and Karv&#238;r (Kolh&#225;pur) respectively. To complete Ptolemy&#8217;s account of this coast it is only necessary to mention the islands of Heptan&#234;sia (Burnt Islands&#160;?) Trikadiba and Peperin&#234;. We are not here concerned with his account of the rest of India.

The arguments of Vincent and Schwanbeck are refuted by M&#252;ller (Geogr. Gr. Min. I. xcviii.) Glaser&#8217;s case is (<foreign lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ausland</foreign> 1891, page 45) that the Malikhas of the Periplus is Malchos III. of Nabath&#230;a (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;49&#8211;71), that the Periplus knows Mero&#234; as capital of Ethiopia, while at the time of Nero&#8217;s expedition to East Africa (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;68), it had almost vanished, and lastly that the author of the Periplus is Basilis or Basil&#234;s, whom Pliny names as an authority for his Book VI. It may be replied that Malikhas is the title Malik and may have been applied to any Arab Sheikh (Reinaud): that the Periplus does not with certainty mention Mero&#234; at all: and that Basilis whether or not a contemporary of Ptolemy Philadelphos was at any rate earlier than Agatharkhid&#234;s (c. 200 <hi rend='sc'>b.c.</hi>), who quotes him (<abbr>Geog. Gr. Min.</abbr> I. 156);     </item><item>(ii) that the Periplus was written at the same time as Pliny&#8217;s work, but neither used the other (Salmasius). This view is refuted by M&#252;ller (<hi>op. cit.</hi> page 155);     </item><item>(iii) that the Periplus was written after 161 <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi> (Dodwell); M&#252;ller has shown (<hi>ibid</hi><corr>.</corr>) that Dodwell&#8217;s arguments are inconclusive;     </item><item>(iv) the received view that the Periplus was written between <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;80 and <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;89 (M&#252;ller);     </item><item>(v) that the Periplus was written about the middle of the third century (Reinaud <foreign lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M&#233;m. de l&#8217;Ac. des Inscr.</foreign> XXIV. Pt. ii. translated in I. A. VIII. pages 330ff). </item></list>

 <pb id="pb543" n="543"/></p><p><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix VI.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Early Greeks and Romans.</hi></item><item><hi>Periplus.</hi></item></list> </fw>The only choice lies between the view of M&#252;ller and that of Reinaud. M&#252;ller argues for a date between <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;80 and <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;89, because the Periplus knows no more than Pliny of India beyond the Ganges, whereas Ptolemy&#8217;s knowledge is much greater: because the Periplus calls Ceylon Palaisimoundou, which is to Ptolemy (VII. iv. 1) an old name: because the Nabath&#230;an kingdom, which was destroyed <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;105, was still in existence at the time of the Periplus: because the Periplus account of Hippalos shows it to be later than Pliny: and because the Periplus mentions king Z&#244;skal&#234;s, who must be the Za Hakal&#234; of the Abyssinian lists who reigned <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;77&#8211;89. It may be replied that the Periplus is not a geography of Eastern Asia, but a guide book for traders with certain ports only: that Ptolemy must have found in his lists three names for Ceylon, Taproban&#234;, Palaisimoundou, and Salik&#234;, and that he has wrongly separated Palai from Simoundou, taking it to mean &#8220;formerly&#8221; and therefore entered Simoundou as the old and Salik&#234; as the modern name,<note id="n543.a" n="A">We learn from Pliny (VI. 22) that Palaisimoundou was the name of a town and a river in Ceylon, whence the name was extended to the whole island.</note> whereas all three names were in use together: that the Nabath&#230;an king Malikhas was simply the Sheikh of the tribe (Reinaud), and points to no definite date: that the Periplus&#8217; account of Hippalos is certainly later than Pliny: and that the Z&#244;skal&#234;s of the Periplus is the Za S&#226;gal or Za Asgal of the Abyssinian lists, who reigned <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;246&#8211;47 (Reinaud).

 </p><p>It follows that Reinaud&#8217;s date for the Periplus (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;250) is the only one consistent with the facts and especially with the Indian facts. As will appear below, the growth of the Hippalos legend since Pliny&#8217;s time, the rival Parthians in Sindh, the mention of Mambaros and the supplanting of Oz&#234;n&#234; by Minnagara as his capital since Ptolemy&#8217;s time, the independence of Baktria, and the notices of Saragan&#234;s and Sandan&#234;s, are all points strongly in favour of Reinaud&#8217;s date.

 </p><p>In the time of the Periplus the ships carrying on the Indian trade started from Myos Hormos (near Ras Abu Somer) or Berenik&#234; (in Foul Bay) and sailed down the Red Sea to Mouza (Musa twenty-five miles north of Mokh&#226;), and thence to the watering place Ok&#234;lis (Ghalla) at the Straits. They then followed the Arabian coast as far as Kan&#234; (Hisn Ghur&#226;b in Hadramaut) passing on the way Eudaim&#244;n Arabia (Aden) once a great mart for Indian traders, but lately destroyed by king Elisar (M&#252;ller&#8217;s conjecture for <hi rend="sc"><choice><orig><foreign lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#922;&#913;&#921;&#931;&#913;&#929;</foreign></orig><reg type="trans"><foreign lang="grc-latn" xml:lang="grc-latn">KAISAR</foreign></reg></choice></hi> of the <abbr>MS.</abbr>) From Kan&#234; the routes to India diverge, some ships sailing to the Indus and on to Barygaza, and others direct to the ports of Limyrik&#234; (Malab&#225;r Coast). There was also another route to Limyrik&#234;, starting from Ar&#244;mata (Cape Guardafui). In all three voyages the ships made use of the monsoon, starting from Egypt in July. The monsoon was called Hippalos, according to the Periplus (chapter 57), after the navigator who first discovered the direct course across the sea, and it has been inferred from Pliny&#8217;s words (VI. 23) that this pilot lived in the middle of the first century <hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi> But Pliny&#8217;s own account shows that, as we should expect, the progress from a coasting to a direct voyage was a gradual one, with several intermediate stages, in all of which the monsoon was more or less made use of. There was therefore no reason for naming the wind from the pilot who merely made the last step. Further though Pliny knows Hippalus as the local name of the monsoon wind in the eastern seas, he says nothing of its having been the name of the inventor of the direct course. The inference seems to be that Hippalos the pilot is the child of a seaman&#8217;s yarn arising out of the local name of <pb id="pb544" n="544"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix VI.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Early Greeks and Romans.</hi></item><item><hi>Periplus.</hi></item></list> </fw>the monsoon wind, and that his presence in the Periplus and not in Pliny shows that the former writer is much later than the latter.

 </p><p>The merchant bound for Skythia (Sindh) before he reaches land, which lies low to the northward, meets the white water from the river Sinthos (Indus) and water snakes (chapter 38). The river has seven mouths, small and marshy all but the middle one, on which is the port of Barbarikon (Sh&#226;hbandar, Haig, page 31) whence the merchants&#8217; wares are carried up by river to the capital Minnagar (near Sh&#226;hd&#226;dpur, Haig, page 32), which is ruled by Parthians who constantly expel one another (chapter 39). These contending Parthians must have been the remnant of the Kar&#234;n Pahlavs who joined with the Kush&#226;ns to attack Ardeshir P&#226;pak&#226;n (<abbr expan="Journal Asiatique">Journ. As.</abbr> [1866] VII. 134). The imports are clothing, flowered cottons, topazes, coral, storax, frankincense, glass vessels, silver plate, specie, and wine: and the exports costus (spice), bdellium (gum), yellow dye, spikenard, emeralds, sapphires, furs from Tibet, cottons, silk thread, and indigo. The list of imports shows that the people of Skythia were a civilised race and by no means wild nomads.

 </p><p>The Periplus next (chapter 40) gives an accurate account of the Ran (Eirinon) which in those days was probably below sea level (Haig, page 22, Burnes&#8217; Travels into Bokhara, III. 309ff), and was already divided into the Great and the Little. Both were marshy shallows even out of sight of land and therefore dangerous to navigators. The Ran was then as now bounded to south and west by seven islands, and the headland Barak&#234; (Dv&#226;rak&#226;) a place of special danger of whose neighbourhood ships were warned by meeting with great black water-snakes.

 </p><p>The next chapter (41) describes the gulf of Barygaza (gulf of Cambay) and the adjoining land, but the passage has been much mangled by the copyist of our only <abbr>MS.</abbr> and more still by the guesses of editors. According to the simplest correction (<choice><orig><foreign lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#7973;&#961;&#959;&#962;&#964;&#951;&#962;&#8217; &#913;&#961;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#951;&#963;&#967;&#969;&#961;&#945;</foreign></orig><reg type="trans"><foreign lang="grc-latn" xml:lang="grc-latn">h&#275;rost&#275;s&#8217; Ariak&#275;sch&#333;ra</foreign></reg></choice>) our author says that next after Barak&#234; (Dv&#226;rak&#226;) follows the gulf of Barygaza and the country towards Ariak&#234;, being the beginning of the kingdom of Mambaros and of all India. Mambaros may possibly be a corruption of Makhatrapos or some similar Greek form of Mah&#226;kshatrapa, the title of the so-called &#8220;S&#226;h Kings&#8221; who ruled here at this period (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;250). According to the reading of the <abbr>MS.</abbr> the author goes on to say that &#8220;the inland part of this country bordering on the Ib&#234;ria (read Sabiria = Sauv&#238;ra) district of Skythia is called ... (the name, perhaps Maru, has dropped out of the text), and the sea-coast Syrastr&#234;n&#234; (Sur&#226;sh&#7789;ra).&#8221; The country abounded then as now in cattle, corn, rice, cotton and coarse cotton cloth, and the people were tall and dark. The capital of the country was Minnagara whence much cotton was brought down to Barygaza. This Minnagara is perhaps the city of that name placed by Ptolemy near M&#226;npur in the Vindhyas, but it has with more probability been identified with Jun&#226;gad (Bhagv&#226;nl&#226;l) which was once called Manipura (Kath. Gaz. 487). Our author states that in this part of the country were to be found old temples, ruined camps and large wells, relics (he says) of Alexander&#8217;s march, but more probably the work of Menandros and Apollodotos. This statement certainly points to <corr sic="K&#226;thi&#226;v&#226;da">K&#226;thi&#226;v&#226;&#7693;a</corr> rather than to M&#226;npur. The voyage along this coast from Barbarikon to the headland of P&#226;pik&#234; (Gopn&#226;th) near Astakapra (H&#226;thab) and opposite to Barygaza (Broach) was one of 3000 stadia = 300 miles, which is roughly correct. The next chapter (42) describes the northern part of the gulf of Cambay as 300 stadia wide and running northward to the river Ma&#239;s (Mah&#238;). Ships bound for Barygaza steer first northward past the island <pb id="pb545" n="545"/><fw type="header" place="margin">     <list type="simple"><item>Appendix VI.</item><item><hi rend="sc">Early Greeks and Romans.</hi></item><item><hi>Periplus.</hi></item></list> </fw>Bai&#244;nes (Peram) and then eastward towards the mouth of the Namnadios (Narmad&#226;) the river of Broach. The navigation (chapter 43) is difficult by reason of rocks and shoals such as H&#234;r&#244;n&#234; (perhaps named from some wreck) opposite the village of Kamm&#244;ni (Kim) on the eastern shore and by reason of the current on the western near <corr sic="P&#226;pik&#233;">P&#226;pik&#234;</corr> (perhaps a sailor&#8217;s name meaning Unlucky). Hence the government sends out fishermen in long boats called Trappaga or Kotumba (Kotia) to meet the ships (chapter 44) and pilot them into Barygaza, 300 stadia up the river, by towing and taking advantage of the tides. In this connection our author gives a graphic description of the Bore in the Narbad&#226; (chapter 45) and of the dangers to which strange ships are exposed thereby (chapter 46).

 </p><p>Inland from Barygaza (that is, from the whole kingdom, which, as we have seen, bordered on Sauv&#238;ra or Mult&#226;n) lay (chapter 47) the Aratrioi (Ara&#7789;&#7789;as of the Mah&#226;bh&#226;rata and Pur&#226;&#7751;as, who lived in the Panj&#226;b), the Arakh&#244;sioi (people of eastern Afghanistan), Gandaraioi (Gandh&#226;ra of N.-W. Panj&#226;b), Proklais (near Pesh&#226;war), and beyond them the Baktrianoi (of Balkh) a most warlike race, governed by their own independent sovereigns. These last are probably the Kush&#226;ns who, when the Parthian empire fell to pieces in the second quarter of the third century, joined the Kar&#234;n Pahlavs in attacking Ardeshir. It was from these parts, says our author, that Alexander marched into India as far as the Ganges&#8212;an interesting glimpse of the growth of the Alexander legend since the days of Arrian (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;150). Our author found old <hi>drakhmai</hi> of Menandros and Apollodotos still current in Barygaza.

 </p><p>Eastward in the same kingdom (chapter 48) is the city of Oz&#234;n&#234;; which was formerly the capital, whence onyxes, porcelain, muslins, and cottons are brought to Barygaza. From the country beyond Proklais came costus, bdellium, and spikenard of three kinds, the Kattybourine, the Patropapigic, and the Kabalitic (this last from K&#225;bul).

 </p><p>We learn incidentally that besides the regular Egyptian trade Barygaza had commercial relations with Mouza in Arabia (chapter 21) with the East African coast (chapter 14) and with Apologos (Obollah) at the head of the Persian Gulf and with Omana on its eastern shore (chapter 36). The imports of Barygaza were wine, bronze, tin and lead, coral and gold stone (topaz&#160;?), cloth of all sorts, variegated sashes (like the horrible Berlin wool comforters of modern days), storax, sweet clover, white glass, gum sandarac, stibium for the eyes, and gold and silver coin, and unguents. Besides, there were imported for the king costly silver plate, musical instruments (musical boxes are still favoured by Indian royalty), handsome girls for the harem (these are the famous Yavan&#238; handmaids of the Indian drama), high-class wine, apparel and choice unguents, a list which shows that these monarchs lived in considerable luxury. The exports of Barygaza were spikenard, costus, bdellium, ivory, onyxes, porcelain, box-thorn, cottons, silk, silk thread, long pepper (chillies), and other wares from the coast ports.

 </p><p>From Barygaza our author rightly says (chapter 50) that the coast trends southward and the country is called Dakhinabad&#234;s (Dakshi&#7751;&#226;patha): much of the inland country is waste and infested by wild beasts, while populous tribes inhabit other regions as far as the Ganges. The chief towns in Dakhinabad&#234;s (chapter 51) are Paithana (Paithan) twenty days journey south of Barygaza and Tagara (Dh&#226;rur) a very large city ten days east of Paithana. From Paithana come onyxes, and from Tagara cottons muslins and other local wares from the (east) coast.

This interesting statement is one of the clearest indications of the date of the Periplus. As Bh&#226;nd&#226;rkar has shown, the elder Saragan&#234;s implies also a younger, who can be no other than Yaj&#241;a&#347;r&#238; &#346;&#226;takar&#7751;i (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;140), and the Periplus must be later than his time. The Sandan&#234;s of the text must have been a ruler of <corr sic="Gujar&#226;t">Gujar&#225;t</corr> and may be identified with the Kshatrapa San&#775;ghad&#226;man (<hi rend='sc'>a.d.</hi>&#160;224).

 </p><p>South of Kalliena (chapter 53) were S&#234;mylla (Chaul) Mandagora (Mandanga&#7693;) Palaipatmai (P&#226;l near Mah&#226;d) Melizeigara (probably Janj&#238;ra) and Byzantion (Chiplun). The words which follow probably give another name of Byzantion &#8220;which was formerly also called Turannosboas,&#8221; the name Toparon being a misunderstanding (M&#252;ller, Geogr. Gr. Min. I. 296). South of this are the islands of S&#234;sekreienai (Burnt Islands), Aigidio&#237; (Angediva), Kaineitai (Island of St. George) near the Kherson&#234;sos (Goa), and Leuk&#234; (Laccadives&#160;?) all pirate haunts. Next comes Limyrik&#234; (the Tamil country) the first marts of which are Naoura (Cannanor or Tellichery, rather than Hon&#225;var, which is too far north) and Tyndis (Ka&#7693;alu&#7751;&#7693;i near Bepur) and south of these Muziris (Kranganur) and Nelkynda (Kalla&#7693;a). Tyndis and Muziris were subject to K&#234;probotras (Keralaputra that is the Cera king) and Nelkynda to Pandion (the P&#226;&#7751;&#7693;ya king of Madura). Muziris was a very prosperous mart trading with Ariak&#234; (North Konkan) as well as Egypt. Nelkynda was up a river 120 stadia from the sea, ships taking in cargo at the village of Bekar&#234; at the mouth of the river. Our author gives an interesting account of the trade at these ports and further south as well as on the east coast, but we are not concerned with this part of his work.

But his geography is far from accurate: he calls Barak&#234; (Dv&#226;rak&#226;) an island, and Barygaza (Broach) a city, of Gedr&#244;sia. Among the cities he names are Argant&#234; (quoted from Hekataios), Barygaza (Broach), Boukephala (Jal&#226;lpur), Byzantion (Chiplun), G&#234;reia, Gorgippia, Darsania famous for woven cloths, Dionysopolis (Nysa&#160;?), Kathia (<corr sic="Multan">Mult&#226;n</corr>&#160;?), Kaspapyros and Kaspeiros (Ka&#347;m&#238;r), Margana, Massaka (in Sw&#226;t), Nysa, Palimbothra (<corr sic="P&#226;taliputra">P&#226;&#7789;aliputra</corr>), Panaioura near the Indus, Patala (thirty-five miles south-east of Haidar&#226;b&#226;d, Sindh), Rhodo&#234;, Rh&#244;gan&#234;, Rh&#244;n in Gandarik&#234;, Saneia, Sesindion, Sinda on the great gulf (perhaps Ptolemy&#8217;s Asinda, Va&#7693;nagar), S&#244;limna, and Taxila.

He says that Sindu (Sindh), is where India begins, the Indus being the boundary between it and Persia. The chief ports of India are Sindu (Debal), which exports musk and nard: Orrhotha (Sur&#226;sh&#7789;ra that is Ver&#226;val) which had a king of its own: Kalliana (Kaly&#226;n) a great port exporting brass, and s&#238;sam (blackwood) logs and cloth having a king of its own and a community of Christians under a Persian bishop: Sibor which also had a king of its own and therefore cannot be Sup&#226;r&#226;, which is too close to Kalliana, but must be Goa, the Sindabur of the Arabs: Parti, Mangaruth (Mangalor), Salopatana, Nalopatana, and Pudopatana which are the five marts of Mal&#234; the pepper country (Malab&#226;r), where also there are many Christians. Five days&#8217; sail south of Mal&#234; lay Sielediba or Taproban&#234; (Ceylon), divided into two kingdoms in one of which is found the hyacinth-stone. The island has many temples, and a church of Persian Christians, and is much resorted to by ships from India Persia and Ethiopia dealing in silk, aloewood, cloves, sandalwood, &amp;c. On the east coast of India is Marallo (Morava opposite Ceylon) whence conch-shells are exported: Then Kaber (Kaveripatam or Pegu. Yule&#8217;s Cathay Introd. page clxxviii.) which exports Alabandinum; further on is the clove country and furthest of all Tzinista (China) which produces the silk. In India further up the country, that is further north, are the White Ounoi or H&#251;&#7751;as who have a king named Gollas (Mihirakula of inscriptions) who goes forth to war with 1000 elephants and many horsemen and tyrannises over India, exacting tribute from the people. His army is said to be so vast as once to have drunk dry the ditch surrounding a besieged city and marched in dryshod.
